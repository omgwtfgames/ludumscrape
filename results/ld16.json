Sometimes it looked a little jerky when you moved around.

In town area, for instance, several of the buildings present in the video walkthough manifested only as invisible walls when we played it. We also occasionally got stuck in walls, and in the last room, where you're supposed to go through the ceiling, neither of us ever figured that out, but we didn't have to because if you just exit the room and enter again, it puts you in the top half with the colors.\n\nI'm not going to subtract any points from the score I gave, because these things  honestly didn't detract from my enjoyment of the game... at the time I thought they were intentional, and took them in stride.

It doesn't sound exactly fun, but that was the idea. Kind of like reversing the exploration theme. And it was supposed to be a bit more adveturish with supporting characters and dialog, but time didn't allow. (And my pixel art skills didn't either, that's why there's a \"robot\" as a character, not anything that would make sense.)\nThe final version is not really super fun or anything, but I'm pretty happy with what I could achieve this time around. It could use much more work on the moving and digging etc., but what 48h game doesn't. If I had more time, I would've made the goals more clear and added lot more to do (achievements etc. too), now it's quite an empty/pointless place.\nTech: Tried to go with flash+flixel, but soon it came apparent that you can really do just one time of a game with flixel, so this is all custom as3. The crappy graphics were done with Paint.Net, Flash CS4 and Corel Painter 11. Sounds sfxr, of course.

It is called I Never Missed Anyone Until The Were All Gone. It is not finished. But it is playable. There's not much to do though and it is very unpolished. And there's probably some glitches in there.\nThe game was made with C++ and uses the SDL, SDL_image and SDL_gfx libraries. The art was done by hand in pencil and was cleaned up in GIMP.\nMy idea was far too ambitious for one weekend, though I did manage to get a lot of the core game logic finished. Drawing my graphics by hand took far too long.\nI plan to continue working on this in the future.\nEDIT: Added direct link to source code.", "author": "Cosr", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-16/?action=preview&uid=1454", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jflsempl/INMAUTWAG-LD16.zip", "Web": "http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jflsempl/games.html", "Source": "http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jflsempl/INMAUTWAG-LD16-src.zip"}, "title": "I Never Missed Anyone Until They Were All Gone", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fe13f99961eb6c0c0f6040de7a4fa653.jpg"], "comments": [[null, "dertom", null, "I like the art-style!
