There are several rules of the game that I think I neglected to mention in the instructions:\n- You can rearrange supplies in the middle of bombing, by pressing \"Unready\". However, moving supplies like this will give them a temporary visibility increase, proportional to the distance moved. Spec Ops have no such movement penalty.\n- Rebel sentiment goes up on a hospital bombing only if you had supplies present in the hospital at the time. (This only applies to the first two cities, because after that you're forced to put some supplies in a hospital at all times.)\nTools used: AS3 with FlashPunk, sfxr, GXSCC, Paint.NET, Photoshop, and some public domain music/photographs. I never used FlashDevelop or worked with FlashPunk until this competition started, but I have to say that I like them both. Definitely an improvement over working with Macromedia Flash.\nUnlike LD19, where I was pretty much done after 24 hours, for this entry I was doing significant programming up until the last minutes. I guess part of it was because I was still learning FlashPunk, and part of it was because I was a little busy the weekend and had to take some breaks from LD. Overall, I didn't quite accomplish everything that I wanted to, but I think it turned out rather nicely.\nHalfway through, I began to have second thoughts about making this game, because it might look like I'm trivializing the Libyan civil war. This game is not intended as a joke or a mockery, but as a serious (albeit light) statement about violence, diplomacy, and power.

Now that that's out of the way...\nI know, it's not exactly \"It's dangerous out there!\" material, but unfortunately the time constraints of Ludum Dare forced me to go light on that. Originally the game was meant to have 25 levels with a text-based cutscene between every five levels, propelling a narrative involving your journey to adulthood and your father guiding you along. Like I said, time constraints caught up and the narrative had to be cut :/ However, the game WAS designed to tell a story about how your father gave you the Eunaborb in order to survive in the universe! The theme WAS considered! :P\nOther cut features include two more songs (one for the menu, one for the level editor) and the ability to load custom levels straight from the main menu, without having to go into the level editor.\nAnyway, I'm quite proud of what I managed to accomplish, especially considering I missed almost the first 12 hours of development :) The game has a full level editor (from scratch). You can import/export map codes directly, and you have three save slots in-game for your favorite maps!\n2 KNOWN GLITCHES:\n- After playing a level from within the PLAY GAME menu, player cannot return to root menu.

I think the screen should be more centered on the player, although not completely locked. Just give more room at the edges so you can see what's ahead. Secondly, the bees take too many hits before they die. It's more like a boss fight than a normal enemy encounter. Mainly, this discourages new players.

Then, press and hold space to select the number of Orphans you wish to follow that particular path.  Release space to send the orphans on their way.\nAt any time, you can flick your mousewheel to recall *all* orphans from every path.

The most successful tower defense games find the balance between interaction & strategy. For example, \"Plants vs. Zombies\" requires one to strategically place the plants as the level progresses, yet keeps the player busy through collecting sun-power, manually bombing zombies, & placing new towers. Also, the player is given almost no choices; they simply press the buttons when enemies appear & click the spikes when the spikes have been destroyed.

Did a couple minor things to make it a bit harder, largely based on people's feedback.  In short: More enemies, less flares, no paths from start to exit by just following the walls.  More updates soon.\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/TBeck%20-%20LD%2020%20-%20Update.swf\nTLDR:\nArrow Keys - Move\nLeft Click - Place Flare (Aim w/ Mouse)\nThe closer you are to a monster, the faster the sonar beeps.  Shoot flares to kill/reveal enemies.\nThanks for your feedback, I will start working on updates tomorrow and put a link to newer versions here (though obviously the official competition version will remain as-is).\nDescription:\nThe easiest way to describe my game is that it's Minesweeper, except you control an actual character and instead of visual clues where the 'mines' are, there are audio clues.  The character has a sonar device which beeps faster/high pitched the closer you get to an enemy.  Walk into a square adjacent to an enemy, and you're dead.\nIf you think you know where an enemy is, you can throw one of your limited supply of flares.  If the area the flare lights up overlaps with an enemy, it dies.  Also, enemies won't attack you on lit-up tiles, even if it's within their range.\nYour goal is to make it through a series of randomly generated caves to make it through to the other side.  As you progress into deeper caves, the monster count increases.  Eventually, the number of flares you get per level starts to decrease.  If you can make it through the final level, with 10 enemies and 0 flares, you win!\nIf you die, your choices are to retry the same layout, try a different layout with the same parameters, or give up, leading to the game over screen (which you may as well check out at least once).  Additionally, there are two different difficulty modes.  The differences are described in-game.\nTools Used:\nLanguage: Flash/Actionscript 3\nIDE: FlashDevelop\nGame Library: Flixel\nMap Editor: DAME (Very sparingly, mostly randomized levels)\nMusic: LSDj in Visual Boy Advance\nSound Effects: Spear & Audacity\nArt: GIMP 2", "author": "fueelin", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-20/?action=preview&uid=3827", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Web": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/Tim%20Beck%20-%20LD%2020%20-%20It%20is%20Dangerous%20to%20Go%20Alone%20in%20the%20Dark.swf", "Web (Post-Comp Update)": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/TBeck%20-%20LD%2020%20-%20Update.swf", "Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/Source%20Code.zip"}, "title": "It is Dangerous to Go Alone in the Dark", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/48ba9aa222f6e99ea26cf11eacf5283d.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cc226b8d34c073491a0d081cd38ccb2a.jpg"], "comments": [["May 2, 2011 @ 5:15am", "billknye", "1863", "Interesting idea.
