I wanted to make some games for a long time, but I have always been too lazy to do so. Until now. Also, I decided to try a new language for the occasion. You might notice that the title of the window is \"hello world\" :)\nI used Flixel as a game engine,  bfxr.net for sounds assets, and http://videogamena.me/ to find a name.\nMy original design was :\n- a survival game, based on scoring and combo\n- PLENTY of ennemies\n- melee fighting\n- grabbing and juggling with enemies\n- \"wall jump\" on knocked-up enemies\nI quickly came with mouvements controls that I found really cool. I had enemies moving around (wall jumping and climbing) shortly after.\nThe I tried to implements combat mechanics. I intended to use the mouse for jungling with enemies and dashing toward them, but I forgot that you couldn't right clic with flash. And that mac users also cannot.\nSo I spend almost the entire first day trying to come with keyboard controls that felt right, but I couldn't. Shortly after midnight I gave up and changed my design to make it a shooting game. I had it working by the time I went to bed.\nI spend the second day adding different type of enemies,  levels, scoring mechanism, sounds, a few visual effects (mostly to give feedback to the player), and a proper debug mode. I spend some time tweaking difficulty, and ended up with far less enemies than before (max is 5/6 right now)\nI felt the game was finished almost 5 hours before the deadline, and even though I could have easily add sprites, a level editor and maybe an enemy editor, I was just too lazy to do so :)\nFor those of you who want to play with the debug mode, you can enable it by pressing SHIFT in the instruction screen. When debug mode is active, you can choose wich level you want to play by pressing 1-5 from this screen.\nEnemies won't automaticly spawn in debug mode.\nAs it is my first game ever, I would love to get feedbacks from you guys.

You can view-source on the HTML document and it should be fairly obvious where the code is.

it is quite poor. i also wanted to add a level-up that brings a new ability for each character.\nCONTROLS - README\nthe controls are simple but you might end up accidentally quitting and losing your progress if you don't know them (sorry). use the arrow keys and enter to select stuff. you can back out of most menus (including the quit menu) by pressing backspace. to check an enemy's hp, you can press backspace at the move/cast/wait menu and arrow over to him and press enter. esc quits the game.\nSTRATEGY\nthis game can be pretty hard so here's a little strategy guide. i encourage you to not read this and try to figure it out by yourself since part of the fun of a strategy game is figuring out the strategy, but if you are having trouble there are some helpful tips here. once you are familiar with the basic mechanics and how the different orbs work, it shouldn't be too hard to beat any battle with the right strategy.\nap (action points): when a cat's turn is up, it gets 4 ap (except the black cat, who gets 5). any ap that isn't spent during a turn will carry over to the next turn, but there is a max of 12 ap.\norb details: if an orb would be created/move to the point a cat is standing on, that cat will lose 1 hp. the only exception is that a cat will not be affected by its own orbs. if two orbs would both occupy the same grid space (provided there isn't a cat on it), they fizzle and are both destroyed.\nplaying the black cat: casting a black orb costs 2 ap. the black cat's orbs will always move one step away from her at the end of any cat's turn. the orbs can move diagonally, but only if she is standing exactly on a diagonal from the orb. if you want to get a sure hit in, end your turn with a black orb right next to the enemy cat such that it will be pushed into him immediately upon ending the turn.\nplaying the yellow cat: casting a yellow orb costs 1 ap per unit of distance away from your cat it is. you can read about the system the yellow orbs are based on here: http://goo.gl/QbJSC. at the end of any cat's turn, yellow orbs are created and destroyed based on these same rules. the main thing to keep in mind is that if there is an empty space next to exactly three yellow orbs (including diagonally adjacent ones), an orb will be created there. so to hit the enemy cat, all you have to do is cast yellow orbs such that he is touching no more or less than three of them at the end of your turn. one effective strategy here is to box the enemy into a corner and just keep putting orbs on the three cells next to him. also check out the example pattern sections on that wiki page, as they will work quite nicely in this game. in the beginning of my gameplay video you can see me shooting a glider at the black cat.\nfighting the white cat: the white cat will duplicate herself if she has any ap at the end of her turn; this is pretty hard to avoid. it costs her 5 ap to cast her aoe damage spell, so you can prevent this by being far enough away that she has to spend her ap on moving within range of you. try to separate her from her duplicate and kill them one at a time. it is rarely a good idea to move toward her, just let her come to you.\nfighting the purple cat: congratulations on making it this far. the purple cat has 8 hp and can be difficult to hit, but he isn't very aggressive. his orbs will take one step randomly in any of the four directions at the end of any cat's turn. if you are playing the black cat, some tricky juking may be necessary to get hits in. try turning your orbs mid-flight by walking to another side of them or to a diagonal. if you are the yellow cat, a strategy of slow advancement works well. wait until you have a lot of ap, then move in and setup a wall of orbs. if you place them well and continue to augment the wall every turn with more orbs in the right places, you can slowly advance towards your opponent and eventually corner him while preventing his orbs from reaching you.", "author": "mes", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=4975", "entry_type": ["Jam Entry"], "downloads": {"windows": "http://queklain.undev.org/ld22/felinus0-win.zip", "crossplatform + source (.love)": "http://queklain.undev.org/ld22/felinus0.love", "mac": "http://queklain.undev.org/ld22/felinus0-mac.zip", "gameplay video": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYWG6Xv8YPk"}, "title": "FELINUS: the cat gods", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/928fb4439e9e599e71ae623d1aa31ac9.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d659c89b0a6b8c7395f036589cbe4f8d.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/da15983c023edc9c5a12edaf6fc02d73.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/plugins/compo2/images/ibronze.gif"], "comments": [["Dec 20, 2011 @ 8:55pm", "Vogie", "9278", "the second white cat is VERY difficult (for me at least) it would be nice if the yellow cat could eat his orbs to heal, also i quite enjoy how you used the yellow cat's orb mechanics in this brilliant game."], ["Dec 20, 2011 @ 9:31pm", "caranha", "7847", "Interesting that each cat had such different mechanics.

As was his nature, he decided to perform some routine quantum mechanical experimentation on it. He had a box, he had a radioisotope, he had a detector, and he had the poison gas. But when he opened the box to see where the cat collapsed to, the box was empty! The cat, he thought, must have ran away. But it hadn't run away. It was, in fact, CATAPULTED INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN DIMENSIONS. Now it walks the maze of emptiness alone, messing with waveforms and heading towards the faint light ahead, the faintest hope of escape.\"\nThis is what I planned to make. An epic maze of tubes and obstacles to navigate as a lonely dimensionless cat. Instead, I was constantly being forced away from programming to visit relatives and fix computers and prepare for the holidays. A majority of the ten or so hours I did use was spent working on the rendering engine instead of, you know, the game, and another majority was spent on a couple persistent and annoying bugs. Not to mention learning how to use flash. By the end of it all, I just didn't have any motivation to go further. Perhaps if there had been a theme I could have done something with, something that had suggested a mechanic, really anything except this one which eliminated all of my good ideas. On top of it, I had to struggle with figuring out Actionscript, which turns out to be a very infuriating language for me. Maybe next time I'll have a better reason to go on, but for now I just have this half-game.\nINSTRUCTIONS (not provided in game):\nClick and drag to rotate the view.\nThe colored node in the center is your cat. (It is not visible to the human eye because of quantum effects and not because I couldn't figure out how images worked.)\nClick on an adjacent node, marked by the blue connections, to move to it.\nColored nodes are doors and switches. (quantum doors and switches of course)\nYou can not move to a door, but if you move to a switch, a door of the same color will vanish.\nTo win, get to the white area at the end of the map, and a new level will start.\nThere were going to be more and more complex types of obstacles than doors, but they were too buggy to fix in time for the end.\nHopefully next time will not be in the middle of a holiday break, have a theme that I know how to use as a mechanic, and start with me actually knowing the language. And maybe I'll even remember that I'm supposed to be making a game and not spend half the time working on rewriting existing technology and equations from scratch.", "author": "VDOgamez", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=1634", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Compo Entry"], "downloads": {"Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43052873/Test.rar", "Flash": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/43052873/Main.swf"}, "title": "Catspace", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/afbcf59bc178c868972d0f6dbdfb1966.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d62e7e04bdc18fddcebec62a1fd49655.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 19, 2011 @ 6:55am", "wbobeirne", "5193", "Interesting 3D effect!

I'm not the best deployer ;)\n****\nHOW TO PLAY\nYou are a small guy who needs to escape from this place he is in (Great story, huh?). Lasers are set around the map and there is a portal somewhere that allows you get out. The portal must be powered for you to leave.\nUsing the WSAD keys you need to move around and discover where to go. When coming across a laser you need to either point it (use ARROW keys to direct laser) at the portal to activate it or direct it to another laser turret to power that and get to the portal that way. You will most likely need to direct lasers at multiple light turrets around the level to create a chain that can reach the portal.\nSelect the level from the drop down list at the top and click Play - you will be launched into the astonishing world that is SOLITUDE.\n-------------------------------------------\nABOUT\nCreated for the Ludum Dare Compo #22\nhttp://www.ludumdare.com/compo/\nBy xandrew\nhttp://www.ludumdare.com/compo/author/xandrew/\nWith this being my first Ludum Dare \u00c3\u00a2\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd I was thinking I\u00c3\u00a2\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll just use this as a learning experience to discover what I need to do BEFORE the next one.

I wanted to make a game about exploring an abandoned space station in zero gravity. It seemed like a really lonely setting in my mind, and you would be investigating why everyone on the stationed vanished.\nIt became apparent around the midway point that I wouldn't be able to make even a simple version of that on my own in 48 hours.\nSo the game, appropriately, drifted a bit from my original idea. What it is now is a prototype of the kind of 2D zero-G movement I want to have. Since I was writing the game code from scratch in Processing (with the exception of the Fisica library for physics) I didn't have time to implement all the systems that would be needed for an exploration/adventure game. I spent most of my time coding the game and coding levels. So I decided to make it a simple traversal game with no story. It became less about exploration and more about figuring out how to make your character ricochet off of ungrabbable surfaces to get to the exit, which turned out to be more challenging and interesting to me than just jumping around.\nUnfortunately this is a little bit off-theme now. I didn't have time to make the levels look more like an abandoned space station so you're just going to have to use your imagination. :)\nI hope you enjoy my first Ludum Dare entry!", "author": "Eliot", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=8628", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Compo Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://eliot.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/games/ld48/ld22/Drift.windows.zip", "Source": "http://eliot.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/games/ld48/ld22/Drift.source.zip", "OS/X": "http://eliot.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/games/ld48/ld22/Drift.macosx.zip", "Linux": "http://eliot.s3.amazonaws.com/releases/games/ld48/ld22/Drift.linux.tar.gz"}, "title": "Drift", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b81798ff8811ffedcdbba1cce7112b27.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7ccbf78709ceff3034578416e9d37890.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 19, 2011 @ 11:02am", "JayCFraser", "7225", "I think that the amount of time the player has to wait between issuing commands in this game detracts seriously from the fun.

This gets rid of some of your life.\nArrow keys to move. Get to exit.\n------\nTrepang (aka \"Project Chordwing\") was done by us! We're Dan, Wilson, and Eric, and we're undergraduates from the University of Victoria. None of us before had any real gamedev experience, so pardon us if you find it pretty crappy. We love it like our child in all its DOS-like goodness.\nTrepang is the story of Wopley the Sea Cucumber, out on an adventure to escape the endless cave. Sadly sea cucumbers aren't that smart, so Wopley doesn't realize the cave is endless. In order to \"complete\" his quest, Wopley must bypass countless evil Starfish, Squids, and Jellyfish blocking his path. But if he can't escape them, how can he defeat them? BY EJECTING HIS OWN ORGANS OF COURSE! Sea Cucumbers actually do that.\nThe theme of being \"Alone\" comes from the idea of being the only one of your kind and how you need to expend yourself in order to survive. Community is uplifting, and the game symbolizes its absence.\nWe coded TREPANG in C and SDL. The game generates random caves using cellular state automata and creates a solvable exit using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The rest is just regular game design magic.

Your goal is to escape Post-Apocalyptic Earth via a rocket. You must balance building of defenses with the building of your rocket, as the zombies *will* overrun you. Sooner than later.\nLiam Mith is, as far as he knows, the last person alive in the world. Any communications by radio ceased about 2 years ago, when the Virus hit. The year is 2047, and the world is much different than now. Technology had made absolutely incredible advances. We were on Mars, we were traveling throughout the the solar system to gather materials. Most governments across the world had crumpled, and people did as they pleased. They used their will to shape the world around them, not other people. It was a golden age.\nUnfortunately, progress sometimes has side-effects. The entire world was connected electronically. Everyone wore an iEye (pronounced eye),  a contact lens that had the power of todays supercomputers thanks to Quantum Computing. Everything, even your toilet, was wired for network access.\nThen the Sun, like it does, screwed everything up when it decided to emit a solar flare so massive it consumed Mercury entirely. The resulting wave of electromagnetic energy had an odd effect, because of the safeguards we had put in place against it to protect our precious electronics. Near instantaneously, every person who was wearing their iEye went abso-freaking-lutely insane. The massive radiation had caused instant cancer in nearly every place of the body, and fried certain parts of the iEye programming. The effects varied pretty widely, but one thing was constant: insanity.\nOur current concept of Zombies does not cover what happened to these people. Image what would happen if every cell in your body simultaneously went through a period of such rapid uncontrolled growth, that you went from standing to mush. The pain these people went through is absolutely indescribable, and if not for their iEyes, they would have been killed instantly. But obviously, that didn't happen.\nThe iEye was the only processor left, and the sudden radiation burst caused it to fuse with the brainstem in most cases. The effect this had was clear and present: you had formings of flesh running about at lightning speed with only animalistic functions left to them, but amplified by Quantum Computing. Essentially, super-intelligent beings with a wisdom score of 0. The remaining people of Earth were almost all engineers who worked underground during the incident, building the sacred electronics in pristine environs.\nLiam Mith was one of those engineers. This is his story, as played by you.\n***STORY***\nThe Post-Mortem can be seen here: http://bit.ly/vKBPUd\nThe timelapse is here: http://bit.ly/sEpTOP", "author": "Bloodyaugust", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3773", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Compo Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://bit.ly/sWdy1y", "Source": "http://bit.ly/sWdy1y"}, "title": "Not Quite Alone", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d58ae0b35714c35e64a344f2f8bdf7ba.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 19, 2011 @ 5:53am", "uzimonkey", "8517", "Seems to be a tower defense game.

The camera did odd things when I tried to climb the \"towers\", like going behind/through walls and forcing me to readjust, which was distracting.

The first battery I found, on top of a tower, actually felt like a discovery and something I'd thought about and worked for. The second two, I basically had to comb the space to find it, which both wasn't fun and also made me feel like I was \"playing a game\". (I actually found the second two batteries by left-hand-rule-ing the wall, which I think if a game ever leads me to do that something went wrong.)

The more anxious you are and the less energy you have, the more likely you will be misunderstood. At the end of the day (you're understoood, or too anxious), you get to recharge in the way you like. The goal of the night cycle is to lower your anxiety and raise your energy for the next day.

I've only slept 7 hours between those times, wich isn't really special or something, but just to let you guys know.\nThe first half hour I was looking for an idea, and I'm not sure how I got this idea, but I was thinking about working together, where you have to leave someone behind.\nYes, there are bugs in this game. Some big bugs. But there just wasn't enough time.\nI learned a lot of this Ludum Dare. A lot about programming, about planning. I really enjoyed the community and was talking on the IRC chat half of the time. People there gave me the motivation to go on, when I was about to quit.\nThe most important things I wanted to improve were the level features, and the amount of levels.

A flock of strange creatures is shooting through the air.\nA giant Pyramid is on the shore and waits for your ritual...\nIn the beginning I felt like an Island would be a good place to feel lonely and when i started to play around with the music I suddenly realized that being Alone does not have to be desolate and negative like i was thinking at first. It can be quite nice to feel yourself on the inside.. that lead me to abandon all ideas of unfriendly environments and led to the game like you can play it now.\nI feel like there could be something more behind the Story of this game, so I will probably keep working on it.\nTools and asset creation:\nI have been using Unity3d for development. I am using the built in lensflares I hope that doesn't violate the rules too much. I wanted to make my own but time didnt let me.\nalso for the textures I have used some photoshop brushes I have downloaded somewhere.\nThe music and sound effects are entirely made in FLStudio with the help of mostly synthesizers(the waves are entirely synth) but also a few samples i recorded with a h4n1 recorder(footsteps, birdsounds).\nModels were done in modo, Textures in Photoshop\nI will upload the whole Unity Project in the next days for current lack of bandwith.\nEdit:\nInstructions:\nUse WASD and mouse for movement, q shows the map e hides it there is no mousecursor in the map menu sadly.\nThe objective of the game is to collect all 6 eggs and place them in the moulds before the the big stones. After each succesful placements you should hear a sound and after all placements the pyramid should have a light on top.

He then wakes up in this prison to find his family frozen in ice.  All he has is his bottle to try and save them.\nMy ideas were bigger than my 24 hours (stupid work!!) allowed me to implement.  There was gonna be demon family, a good and bad ending, and you'd have to face yourself!  Ooo and there were going to be a couple brief cutscenes.\nAll things considered, given the fact that this is my first attempt at any kind of game making contest, let alone a timed one, I'm very proud of my entry here.

After the basic story, the 5 dead characters (Romeo, Juliet, Paris, Mercutio and Tybalt) are given the chance to use a time machine to change the past. Each player takes on the role of one of these characters, taking it in turns to change the past to try and fulfil their objectives.\nControls are as follows:\nPress 'left' and 'right' arrow keys or use the scene navigation bar at the top to move between scenes. Text that can be changed is highlighted in green (for original) and red (for changes), with the one on top being currently used. Click on the lower option to swap it in.\nYou can also 'lock off' a decision by pressing the button on the top right corner. Locking off a decision or choosing a decision each take a turn.\nThe objectives for each character are laid out in a scene one to the right of the final scene (yeah, it needs a button). It also shows the current progress of each of the characters.\nThe game ends either when a player gets all 6 of their objectives, or when all the options have been locked out (note that we didn't get to implement this).\nHopefully we'll have the online multiplayer on this will be working soon.

It's a puzzle platformer based around a mechanic of \"uniqueness\".  The style is somewhat similar to that of \"The Company of Myself\".\nNote: the opening screen says \"I am not very special.\"  You might miss it if you press buttons and such during load.\n=====\nOS specific notes:\nWindows users: *You should be totally fine.*\nIf running OneOfAKind.exe doesn't work for you, give OneOfAKind_VS.exe a shot. (You'll need the .NET Framework for that version)\nOSX users: *You should be totally fine, as long as you extract OneOfAKind.app from the .dmg file.  Do not try to run it within the .dmg.*\nNote, however, that the download is ridiculously large (150MB) and the .app is even larger (>400MB), because I had to fit the entire Mono install in there.  Just delete it after you play.\nLinux users: Tao seems to be broken under 64-bit, so I don't know if you can run if you're using 64-bit.  If you're under 32-bit, it runs fine if you install mono.  You need to install the following packages:\nmono-runtime\ngtk-sharp2\nlibsdl1.2debian-all\nlibsdl-mixer1.2\nlibsdl-ttf-2.0-0\nlibsdl-image1.2\nAlternatively, you can run the windows version using wine.  Simply use winetricks mono2.8 to install mono and you should be good to go.\nIf you can't get the game to run, you can just watch a video of me playing through the game here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6WRB7Vl3dE\n(Note: Sorry, there's no \"quit\" button--just close the application window to exit)\nIf your keyboard is super-duper-weird, you can use Enter instead of Space or R instead of Escape.\n======\nI don't think the puzzle difficulty is quite too hard...there's a little more you can do with it, but obviously I don't have time for more than there is right now.\nFun fact: if you want to have a shot at editing the levels, you can edit the images under the /lvl directory.  The level[x].png files are the tile maps, while level_backdrop[x].png is the background that gets displayed.\nApologies for any weird glitches or bugs you run into--this was made in less than 48 hours after all (closer to 24, considering how much time I spent flailing around before I actually got started).\nFramework/tools used:\n-C# with SDL.net and Mono\n-Visual Studio 2010 to develop, MonoDevelop for release\n-Graphics done in GIMP\n-Music in FL Studio\n-Sound with FL Studio/bfxr\nMy first LD, and it was a lot of fun, despite being terribly unprepared for it and freaking out when I couldn't seem to think of any puzzles.\n--DDRKirby(ISQ)\n=====\nUpdate: the download links now point to v1.01, which adds no content but fixes a bug that causes the game to crash when you reach the ending (yeah...).\nIf you really want to be strict about the 48 hour guideline (i started late anyhow), you can get v1.00 here:\nWindows: http://db.tt/8o9U8Tzz\nLinux: http://db.tt/rlrftTaw\nOSX: http://db.tt/l85ISncw <- requires Mono + SDL frameworks", "author": "DDRKirby(ISQ)", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=7285", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Compo Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50254977/Coding%20Projects/One%20of%20a%20Kind/OneOfAKind_v1_01_win.zip", "Soundtrack": "http://ddrkirbyisq.bandcamp.com/album/one-of-a-kind-original-soundtrack", "Linux": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50254977/Coding%20Projects/One%20of%20a%20Kind/OneOfAKind_v1_01_linux.tar.gz", "OS/X": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/50254977/Coding%20Projects/One%20of%20a%20Kind/OneOfAKind_v1_01_osx.dmg", "Source": "https://bitbucket.org/DDRKirbyISQ/oneofakind"}, "title": "One Of A Kind", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0f8dec39029c2643902bd307f9966f52.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6c42075a121023d059b0067d1ce783c8.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2583bf5955b1cd9e0981b1bc7189c3ab.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cd736d42977490b5e1c20a16492d23ec.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/97e570c6aca1faad562c625ee4cd1dd5.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/plugins/compo2/images/ibronze.gif"], "comments": [["Dec 19, 2011 @ 7:52am", "DeadlyFugu", "8281", "Fun, but the some of the levels were a bit repetitive."], ["Dec 19, 2011 @ 4:05pm", "iforce2d", "7091", "The linux download file seems to be invalid, says it's not a gzip format file.

Press \"R\" or \"Escape\" to reset if it gets stuck.\nYour objective is to get to the checkpoint, marked by a light-blue square towards the top of the map.\nEach turn you can move one of your guys by clicking on one of the glowing squares - these represent the squares you can move to. If there are mutants in your line-of-sight then you will have a chance to shoot one of them. Any neighbouring mutants of the same colour will also be killed.\nThen it will be the mutants' turn to move! If a mutant moves to a square adjacent to one of your team that team member will be killed.\n---\nKnown issues:\n- Line-of-sight isn't spot on, and probably could be made more intuitive/clear/consistent.\n- Pathfinding is sometimes wrong.

None of his opponent could survive under his blade. His body was immortal because he had stolen the cloak of invisibility of the Death. As a revenge, the Death cast a curse on him - not only the Death, nobody in the world could find this great warrior. Year after year, the loneliness made the warrior going crazy - now, there was only one thing left for this immortal one, fight against his spell-cloned body.\nThis is a First-Person fighting/action game.\nIMPORTANT: You need a mouse with 2 buttons(Left & Right) to play this game. Touchpad of NB is not suitable for this game.\n============\nControls\n============\n#Attack\nThe success of attack depends on if you could land it on your opponent's vulnerable bits. The enemy's vulnerabilities will be exposed when he has lost his defense stance(attacking, blocked by your shield). And there are 2 type of vulnerabilities: Far & Near(with red circle in it). Slashing attack can only reach the near vulnerabilities while piercing attack could reach both.\n##Piercing: Click with LMB(Damage: 1-3)\n##Slashing: Drag with LMB(Damage:1)\n#Defend\nThe enemy will attack your head, chest, or legs, so you need to position you shield at the right height while defending. When enemy begins attack, one part of the screen(upper/mid/lower) will flash red to inform you where he is targeting. Use your RMB to defend yourself as follows:\n##Shield: Hold down RMB at the red screen area.\n##Block: Hold down RMB just before the enemy's weapon reach your body! If you push RMB too early, blocking will not be triggered but you can still defend successfully.\n============\nHints\n============\nIf you've defeated the warrior, the attributes of him will be randomized in the next game. The \"Attack\" attribute may be a little puzzled. In this game, it means the percentage to land a power attack which could make the camera shake a lot even if you defense successfully.\nThis game seems quite challenging at start, until you've learned how to attack efficiently and master the art of blocking.", "author": "Spotlightor", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3035", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Compo Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LD%2322_WarriorCursedByLoneliness_WIN.zip", "Web": "http://spotlightor.com/lab/unity3d/ld22", "OS/X": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LD%2322_WarriorCursedByLoneliness_MAC.zip", "Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LD%2322_WarriorCursedByLoneliness_ProjectFile.zip"}, "title": "Warrior cursed by Loneliness", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/76a35fe732e7e2314714a7019c5e8452.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/429a198c66f404e14ce44591b0b5dde1.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/216fa43a0126c000457ecab932f64ef7.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f5c7b9f778889bc1a30728bfce31b41e.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a52777d3185e21e8cdca55c7fa1a221a.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 19, 2011 @ 8:48am", "rogberth", "8913", "I enjoyed it.

Does anyone know a good way to map in java OTHER than defining rectangles where you can/can't go. Better question: can someone tell me that way? I'm sure I did a very poor job of it.\nIn perspective, though, I'm happy with it! I learned a lot about game programming, and I'm hoping to do much better next time. Thanks for giving it a look! I hope you try it and enjoy what little it has to offer. Have a nice day!\nControls:\nUse arrow keys to navigate the menu, space to select/interact.

He did not have a real horse - so lonely he was.\nHe was spending his days over a pint of ale since he did not see a purpose in his life. One dark and rainy day he was sitting in the tavern \"Mug of hero\", sinking his miserable life in alcohol as usual.\nWhen he finally lost count of how much ale he has drank his blurry attention was captured by a  strange conversation.  He heard that a daughter of a King was recently captured by a band of necromancers from the Spookywood forest, lead by the Evil Wizard Magazu al'Thaal.\nOnly a true hero would have the courage and the SKILL to take the epic quest and save her people whispered. And, as a nice side bonus, the King promised her hand and a little bit more than a half of the kingdom to the savior.\nAll in sudden the knight realised that the princess would fill the gap in his miserable life or at least cook and more. Thus, after a few days of hangover, he took his licheny wooden sword and faithful wooden horse and marched to meet his destiny.\nGame is made on HtmL5 + javascript.\nBest to play on google Chrome or Mozzila Firefox.\nWe made the entire game from scratch in 72 hours.\nIncluding all the coding, scripting, login and account system, images, models and storyline.\nHope you like it !\nMade by Paulius Rumsa,\nMaxim Solovjov\nand Justinas Sneideris.", "author": "Dark Adventure", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3215", "entry_type": ["Jam Entry"], "downloads": {"Web": "http://lknight.x10.mx/"}, "title": "The Lonely Knight", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e10789fa32be58a7ea1ddc7b1a0e644e.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0bc39bafe3100c81d9a1afb7ab334014.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9cda0eaccc3e855b9dba016d146ae2f3.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cd881b944ba1dad69046f4361fbca95b.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/906c3b519c915b1256be83f0f0920580.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 20, 2011 @ 7:11am", "CaptainFresh", "8769", "I liked the graphics, the rest was pretty meh."], ["Dec 21, 2011 @ 11:20pm", "vandriver", "4241", "is the second jump supposed to be possible?  i couldn't make it.  you shouldn't really put that kind of obstacle right in the beginning of your game.  you can likely only make that with a thorough knowledge of the engine or luck/practice.  no one wants to jump into a pit several times before even playing the game, no matter how nice the pit looks(and the art is superb)"], ["Dec 21, 2011 @ 11:50pm", "JoeCool", "4216", "nice art but the gameplay was kind of strange.

There are also breakable objects in the level which you can break through while rolling.Also...please don't step into the fire....it hurts.\nWhen you are caught, you can retry the same level, but your score will be reset to zero.\nDefault controls: ( Can be changed in Options )\n[UP] -> Jump\n[DOWN] -> roll\n[SPACE] -> activate bomb\nGood luck ...and pray that our level generator doesn't cough up impossible levels.\nps: We are very sorry that we can't give binaries to all the Linux and MacOs guys(and girls) out there . XNA at fault here :) . We will put up a Youtube Video soon, to show the Game to you too.", "author": "SaiKai", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=5295", "entry_type": ["Jam Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/459733/LudumDare22/LudumDare22_LeaveMeAlone.zip", "XNA Redist": "http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15163 "}, "title": "Leave Me Alone", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e68359f0c6df5864e0cc26ed106387c0.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e2d578566ebc9b34626f3d04e5a75c1e.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/090a066954353258a3a6e46cc196f5b3.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c412316bebc49b1a3535f6e62a8348af.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/plugins/compo2/images/isilver.gif"], "comments": [["Dec 20, 2011 @ 11:39am", "Jack", "7315", "it's crashing the moment I open it"], ["Dec 20, 2011 @ 3:01pm", "Cell", "3295", "Looks cool.. :)"], ["Dec 20, 2011 @ 8:38pm", "Madea", "9280", "@Jack: as SaiKai said, you need xna to start it :) I forgot that I don't have it on my Laptop and it crushed when I started it.

It's probably the only submission about a murder/suicide.  A man pushes his wife out of a hot air balloon so he can be truly alone, only to face the wrath of karma.  He dies, and ends up in limbo where he will be alone for eternity.  The funny thing is, he likes it.  He's finally at rest.  But there's more to it than that.  He's insane.  And not in an interesting and quirky way, in a \"I painted a portrait of you with my feces, but I ate it before I had a chance to give it to you\" kind of way.  There is no hot air balloon, he just pushes her out the window and runs into the street.  Those are not birds, they're cars.  Those are not fighter planes and UFOs, they're police.  Under it all, this is a pretty dark story about a man who murders his wife and commits suicide by cop.  But that's depressing and hard to draw, so you get clouds and balloons.  I thought you'd enjoy that more.\nThis is an HTML5 game, so it's best to use the latest version of Chrome or Firefox.  Opera and Safari also work.

That doesn't make it any less terrible - the game reminds me of many horribly generic Flash games, but without the presentation, addictiveness or convenience - but I hope that the completely unrelated kitten bonus acts as some compensation for this.\nI probably won't be developing this further, though if I do I think I'd turn it into a multi-event game, tune the gameplay/opponents a bit more, add a few little features to give it more depth, and vastly improve the presentation.", "author": "shockedfrog", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=1078", "entry_type": ["Jam Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.shockedfrog.com/misc/al1-win.zip"}, "title": "Al1", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/fa15526a468bb0654b864fbfe515d7be.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e720eb2db158c0c562cd2afed58cbcf0.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 21, 2011 @ 10:26pm", "Jorjon", "5268", "I really liked this game.

Much more content was planned (more levels, a score counter and some music for example), but I encountered some complex issues that made me run out of time. I may add some of the planned features post-mortem. The game is written from scratch using C++/SFML.\nI am really thrilled to test all those games! Hats off to every brave human being participating in LD48/LD72. It is really hard, but I had a lot of fun.\nHave fun testing! :)", "author": "Elusive", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=5895", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Compo Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://bit.ly/eLD22", "Source": "http://bit.ly/eLD22src", "Timelapse": "http://bit.ly/eLD22t", "Windows (Christmas Edition)": "http://bit.ly/eLD22c"}, "title": "LEFTalone", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f1c07147cf1d4d184356ebacae915e4a.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ae658fa6a87cbb8e47dcc4be1a4ca644.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/aacaa75c2a7d5cb3fb5c406c100ac543.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/plugins/compo2/images/ibronze.gif"], "comments": [["Dec 19, 2011 @ 1:50pm", "galman", "5971", "Regular zombie shooter game.

Every one of them has been left behind by a real person--such as you--entering the realm, and not fictional beings thought up by a developer.\nThere is no way to know who left them behind. No name, no link, no nothing. You explore alone. You leave alone.

It's recommended that you first look around to discover a blip.\nChrome highly recommended. This thing is iffy about if it wants to work with other browsers; I've had mixed success with Firefox.\nOH, and for some reason the library I'm using locks your movement if you hit Q, and won't give it back. So don't hit Q. I wish I could have fixed that.\nWHAT IS THIS?\nEach blip is generated from previous users, based on how they explored while they were looking around. When you leave the page, your own exploration--your \"memories\"--will become another one of those blips.\nIt's rather difficult to call this a game, I suppose... I was trying to create something artsy that pushed the limits of what a game is, based on the definition that a game is an \"Interactive Experience.\" I'm not sure how well I did.\nTHE TECHNOLOGY\nThis uses WebGL, PHP, Ajax, MySQL, HTML, and JavaScript.\nGoing into this, I knew NOTHING about WebGL, PHP, Ajax, or MySQL, and the last time I used HTML and JavaScript was ten years ago.\nDon't ask me how I pulled it off.\nMaaaaaajor thanks/credit/props to so many tutorial sites I can't even remember right now, but probably most of all to a man known as Paul Lewis.

Especially if there was some simple raycasting lighting. But it still has it's mood. Cartoony sound and abstract graphics take me out of the \"alone\" mood. But they are there, distinct, and accomplish what they are there for in terms of gameplay. I like the projectile trailing particles. I think this (rather fast-paced) game would be suitable with an actiony soundtrack. But since the theme was \"alone\", perhaps a less abstract and \"slower\" gameplay may have worked better. The AI isn't terribly smart, but it's fine. I think with such high relic goal, there should be a minimap with explored areas shown or at least distinct environment features. Hunting for every one might be a big chore and I have to admit I didn't see the end. Good entry, but I'd like to see a more innovative idea behind it.

Shot zombies.\n** For the following you'll need LOVE 1.7.2 or later to run the game. You can grab it here: http://love2d.org/\nWindows: If love is installed, you can double click super_square_zombie_killer.love to start it. If love is unzipped you can start the game from the command line \"love super_square_zombie_killer.love\"\nLinux: Your distro probably has LOVE in its repos.

Useful for pushing back a crowd of zombies, but has a long reload time.\nAssault Rifle: Large magazine capacity, medium damage, and bullets go through zombies. Good for general killing.\nLight Machine Gun: Powerful and can fire a large number of bullets before being reloaded. Watch out for its large spread and long reload times.\n----- Controls -----\nMove: W, S, A, D\nReload: R\nPistol: 1\nShotgun: 2\nAssault Rifle: 3\nLight Maching Gun: 4\nAim: mouse\nShoot: mouse left\nNext/prev gun: mouse wheel\nQuit to menu: Escape\nToggle fullscreen: F5\n----- Settings -----\nFullscreen can be toggled by pressing F5.

Your goal in this game is to stay sane.  Keep yourself busy with the two mini-games to ward off anxiety, but be careful!  Making mistakes will cause you to more rapidly lose your composure.\nThere is no real win condition; you can keep going forever.  There is however a definitive lose condition.  The look on your character\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds face will clue you in to his current sanity level, as will the state of his surroundings.  You will know when you\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdve lost and the game is over.  Even if you decide this game isn\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdt for you, it\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds at least worth intentionally going insane to see the effects!\nThere are two mini-games that can either help or harm your sanity.  Pressing LEFT and RIGHT in the main screen lets you switch between them, while pressing ENTER starts a given game.  Use the ARROW KEYS to navigate through the game and ENTER to activate the currently selected node.  If you do well, your characters sanity increases.  Do poorly, and it will decrease much more quickly.  When you\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdre done with a game, press ESCAPE to go back to the main screen.\nThe computer allows you to solve simple, randomly-generated Boolean logic puzzles.  A red line represents a powered wire, while a white line is unpowered.  Pressing ENTER on one of the logic gates (nodes) cycles through the various logical operators: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR.  The objective is to set up all the gates so that current flows from the left all the way to the final node on the right.  Pressing SPACE during this mini-game will check your results.  If you\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdre wrong, you\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdll lose sanity.  If you\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdre right, your sanity increases and a new puzzle is generated.\nThe bass lets you play the other mini-game: composing.  This allows you to write an accompaniment that is played alongside the game\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds main music track.  This game\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds display is analogous to staff paper.  The window represents one measure, with time moving forward from left to right.  You can turn on up to three simultaneous notes per rhythmic division (sixteenth note).  Note pitch increases as you move up the screen, with the bottom being a C.  The red lines represent chord tones; stay inside the harmony and your sanity will increase.\nI\u00e2\ufffd\ufffdm not sure what else to say.  Sure it\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds flawed/incomplete, but I think it\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds pretty cool anyway!", "author": "fueelin", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-22/?action=preview&uid=3827", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Compo Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/LD%2022%20-%20Filling%20Time.swf", "Web": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/LD%2022%20-%20Filling%20Time.swf", "Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2908100/src.rar"}, "title": "Filling Time", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b3b763066864ff61c22631cb65a061f6.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4b7cf7f80a1bfabea9766abd6e23175c.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 19, 2011 @ 9:07am", "bach", "5433", "Ok, I couldn't really figure this out :( Please supply some more specific instructions..

At least money bags don't reset, though I'd like a few more checkpoints. My biggest gripe is that this doesn't fit the theme. It was \"alone\", not \"kittens\".

I tried my best so far in this one spending soooo much time to get it done. I agreed that I would do a physics game for this Ludum because everyone loves physics. The only hard part was fitting the theme into it which I got an idea for. It took me a lot of resources to make this game so I will list them here:\n-Photoshop (Huge help)\n-Mixcraft (My Audio from guitar and synth)\n-Audacity (Lowering or sound files)\n-FlashDevelop (The program for flash 'Duh')\n-FlashPunk Classes\n-Box2d physics\n-Probably more that I cant think of right now\nAudio: Created by mixcraft mainly. The sounds were either recorded from my guitar or a composition of notes in mixcraft\nGraphics: I basically used vectors and textures in PS for the graphics. This took a good portion of the time I had. The trash can especially took the longest because of 2 layers\nTheme: I came up with a story line sort of for the whole game. I said that you were a kid growing up with your family and your family is leaving for a Christmas party and you dont wanna go. So you stay home and you cant find anything to do. Eventually you find a bouncy ball and start playing with it and that is what the game is based off of. It continues through the different levels\nGamePlay:\nThe concept of the game is to do teh objective of the level, which is usually to knock down all of the blocks or get the ball into the trash can.

As he says this, gravity stops for a moment and the player can jump and float to the next pillar. At each pillar the player would say something new, indicating the journey out of depression is working. As the player climbs higher and higher the background would become lighter and eventually the stars falling in the background would become leaves and the sun would break through the fog in the background.\nObviously the game doesn't have much of what I've described in it - you can move and jump with the arrow keys and spacebar.

There are some critters lurking in the dark, and they have very, very bright eyes.\nUsing the eyes of the critters wandering around each stage, it is possible to make a mental map of where are the platforms and jump around to the exit.  All the levels are doable with that can be seen and what can be inferred by the position of every creature or by jumping around the area.  Some of the jumps require almost pixel-perfect collision that, together with the already frustrating environment, make the experience a little less enjoyable than what I wanted.\nPlease don't mind the name and the fake Japanese characters on the title screen.  In the README there is the reason behind it all, for these that are interested.\nKuudou is made in C++ using the SDL and SDL_mixer libraries.

I also liked how the game subtly walks you past a series of areas you can't get to yet at first-- on my first trip through the level I thought I was just picking arbitrary paths, and didn't realize I was being guided in a way that was also showing me where my goals were.

The triangle jump was a bit odd but was manageable, what I had more of a problem with was that there didn't seem to be a way to fall \"down\", you could fall left and at an angle or down and at an angle but not straight down and this made it very hard to position oneself onto small platforms. Also maybe it is just my machine (Flash often runs slow for me) but I often had jerky frameskips/responsiveness issues when there was vertical scrolling going on. And the camera didn't help things, it often would point fairly high up vertically and I wouldn't be able to see what was in a sometimes very short pit except by jumping into it. Having to go ALL the way back to the beginning on death is very harsh for a game with simultaneously so much precision jumping and also a jump that impedes precision jumping and also a beginning which is a long featureless hallway. I got a ways in, then lost all three lives on a section (near the headband) over a pit that the camera wouldn't let me see which sections down were safe or not, and where there was a lot of frameskip-inducing vertical scrolling.

Sorry, but you should try harder or give more content."]], "images": [{"url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/204ec7456a28dfe36134502440fbb965.jpg", "path": "full/fc5f7cb0e7b656f5fda0179dc106d53547e959f6.jpg", "checksum": "151a4bb71c6ff486be2ffdb298ecd526"}]}
