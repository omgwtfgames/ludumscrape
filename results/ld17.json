Stuff will be air dropped whether you like it or not; you can call in a new building by left-clicking, or a soldier by right-clicking. You lose points if a soldier drowns, and the game ends when the island capsizes.\nWish List:\nThere was supposed to be more, like ordering soldiers to build or destroy buildings, or build flotation devices, but, I couldn't get there in time. There was also supposed to be a song, but I didn't allot enough time to learn to use GarageBand - if you sit at the title screen long enough, you can hear some of the samples I was going to use.\nKnown Bugs:\nThere's a bug with the soldiers where when they drown, they still move around, oops.

Guide your people to the safest mountains, build boats, teleportation towers and mighty shelters before it is too late!\nEDIT: tiny post-deadline bugfix. Archives have been updated. If you want to (and you should) judge the pre-deadline version, just assume the game would crash when trying to select a non completed ark =) Thanks to allen and Almost for reporting it!\nHow to run\n----------\nWindows: double-click arks_of_mercy.bat, or similar. You can change the window size by editing the .bat files or creating your own.\nGNU/Linux: run arks_of_mercy.sh (depending on your file manager, double clicking on it might be enough). You will need the following libraries: Lua 5.1, SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, SDL_gfx, SDL_ttf.\nYou can modify this file to change the window size (especially if the game doesn't run at the first try). For instance, replace the contents with:\nlua main.lua 800 600\nor\nlua main.lua 1024 768 fullscreen\n(or run these commands directly...)\nControls\n--------\nThe game was designed to be used with a gamepad (I have a DualShock clone), but provides keyboard replacements as well.\nD-pad/Arrows : move\nLeft and right shoulders / S and F : rotate camera\nLeft and right triggers / E and D : zoom in and out\nCross / Spacebar : bring menu, select, action, etc.\nCircle / G : cancel\nAnd shortcuts, without which it is still possible to play:\nSquare / R : place beacon\nTriangle / T : place boat\nNow of course, all gamepads have different numbering systems and that kind of stuff, and since there is no ingame keymapper, you'll have to modify the file keymap.lua. It should be mostly self explanatory. You can of course modify the default keys as well.\nAdditional keys, mostly for fun:\n1: toggle wireframe\n2: toggle land color\n3: print FPS rate\n4: while held, water raises a lot faster\nEscape: quit instantly\nGameplay\n--------\nThe inhabitants of this small world are pretty dumb. They will wander randomly, and only flee the water when it is really close. But they can get trapped on islands and die tragically there when the water comes, which is why you need to guide them.\n1. Beacons\nPlace a beacon above the land by bringing the menu and chosing the weird four-piked item, or alternatively, by pressing \"place beacon\". The circle around it is its area of influence. Guys in it will be attracted to the beacon.\nTo remove a beacon, place the cursor close to it and press \"beacon\" or \"action\" (shortcuts come in handy when objects are close to each other).\nNote that you have a limited number of beacons at the same time on the map. When the limit is reached, the first ones will disapear.\n2. Boats\nCreate a boat on the sea by bringing the menu and chosing the flat round item, or alternatively, by pressing \"place boat\".\nPressing \"action\" near the boat will bring its own menu, with three items: load, unload, destroy.\nChose load, move the cursor to a land zone with people, and press \"action\". The boat will start moving towards the goal, and when it arrives, all the people within the area of influence indicated when aiming will try to board the boat.\nThere are only 10 places on a boat.\nUnloading works the same. Sometimes the boat will not unload, because the terrain is not safe, try again seconds later, or further away.\nDelete, well, deletes the boat, including its passengers.\nThere is also a limited number of boats, but the first ones won't be automatically deleted. Instead, the \"boat\" item will not show up in the menu.\nSometimes the guys are really dumb and throw themselves to the sea while trying to board the ship. Oh well...\n3. Teleportation towers\nThe third item in the menu, tall pyramid with four legs, is a teleportation tower. Place it on the ground, like a beacon. Note that it takes some time to build. You can cancel its creation by bringing up its menu and chosing the delete item.\nOnce built, a new item will appear in its menu: linking to another tower. Chose it, move near another tower, and press \"action\". Note that the towers must be in line of sight. A red line (instead of the lightnings) indicate non line of sight.\nOnce linked to another tower, a new item appears: calling people. All the people in a close range around the tower will enter it, and reappear outside the linked tower. Use in conjunction with a beacon to attract people as close as possible.\nNote that you are limited to 4 towers. Note also that the links are one way. If you can explicitly make to towers point at each other, it is in no way mandatory. You can make a network, or a chain, or anything you like. Remember also that you can change the target by selecting again the link item.\n4. Arks\nThe ultimate shelter. The boats are safe, but they contain only a few people. To save your entire population, you need to build these huge floating cities. Each shelter can hold 100 persons.\nYou are not limited in the number of shelters you build.\nBeware, the construction is not automatic like teleport towers. The construction speed is proportionnal to the number of people close to the ark! Use beacons to attract people really close!\nOnce built, the ark's menu contains one option: making the close people embark. You cannot destroy an ark, or unload its passengers.\nOnce the water reaches the ark, it will start floating to safety!\n5. Victory?\nThere is no winning or losing condition. The aim is to save as many people as possible. The game stops when all the people are either dead, or rescued.\nDuring the game, you can check your advance by bringing up the menu. The numbers shown are the people still in need of rescue, and the people rescued. The game always starts at 500.\nLicense\n-------\nThe source code is under GNU GPL v3.\nMusic and graphics are cc-by-nc-sa.\nGNU/Linux notes:\n----------------\nThe game comes with a precompiled binary (evolcore.so) created on a Ubuntu system.

The goal in the game is to prevent fish from reaching the open sea.\nThe fish spawn from the top left corner and try to get to the bottom right corner using the shortest possible path. Islands can be created to make their journey longer and more difficult. Towers can be built on top of the islands to actually kill them.\nIslands can be created and towers can be built using the left mouse button. There's only one type of tower, but it can be upgraded multiple times. Islands can be sold using the right mouse button.\nAs the game is rather simple, I made it quite hard to even get the highest upgraded tower. As in almost all tower defense games, it matters a lot where you build your towers and which towers you upgrade.\nIt's a 3D game and the camera can be freely moved and rotated (although there's not much need for it).\nI used 3ds Max to create the models and Paint Shop Pro for the textures. The game is written in C++ and OGRE is used for the rendering. The Windows download link has sources included. The source link contains only the sources.\nThis was my first time entering Ludum Dare and I'm happy that I got at least something done. I'm happy with how the game looks as I'm no artist and I think I did good for myself. But the gameplay is too simple. It would've needed at least a freezing tower or something like that. I should've taken some time away from other things. I used about 19 hours in total including planning and this little documentation. It was a bit less than I had intended, though life rarely goes as planned :)\nEdit: I had originally planned on having both direct3d and opengl options but on one case the game would crash even before the choosing dialog if direct3d option was enabled. Then I just commented it out in the plugins file. Now I re-enabled it since I guess it causes less problems that way. It can be disabled just by commenting (or removing) the direct3d line in bin/plugins-windows.cfg\nEdit2: Ok sorry for the crashing. Seems there was a bug with fish speed normalization. In a very special case a fish might have a zero speed which resulted in division by zero which later on led to crashing.

Move with the arrow keys, fairly straight forward there, double tap a direction to dash attack. Dash attacking into an enemy kills it (or at least hurts it,) and gives you a glowing aura. You can use that aura to figure out how close you are to the objective (blue = really far away, red = close) There are three levels, kind of, even tho they are all the same, just with more enemies that move slightly faster. You get some plot between levels, and then the DRAMATIC PLOT TWIST at the end. Its kind of a depressing game. Sorry. You also will fire a huge spread of projectiles that home in on enemy's if you dash attack enough. These frequently end up killing offscreen enemies and giving you randomly awesome kill combo multipliers. THIS IS A FEATURE! NOT A BUG!... okay, well, maybe its a bug.\nThe For loop that builds the level is kinda broken (actually, the whole level building part is kinda broken...) so it takes a second to load the playstate, just bare with it, it (probably) didnt crash.\nThis needs some hardcore optimizations to be totally honest, but its still pretty fun, and this was a totally new experience for me. (I have all of one other game under my belt, and have only been learning actionscript and flixel for a few months...)\nOh... code note, I made this in flash develop using flex 3.4 and flixel v2.34.\nI used some vst stuff, fruity loops, an old midi man keyboard, a simmons sd7k drumset, and an old epiphone guitar for the soundtrack. This includes the sound fx. I was trying to get all of the audio to blend together and create a really surreal feel, and Im fairly happy with it. I wish I could have synched the piano to the text better, but ala's flash is balls for handling sound.\nThe graphics where all drawn in Graphics Gale, mostly with the pencil tool, although I did cheat and let code do some of the work for me (like the water is actually just a 32x32 square that gets re sized to make waves...)\nAnyhow, Enjoy.", "author": "zez", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=1840", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://drop.io/kallistasdream", "Web": "http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1272241863", "Linux": "http://drop.io/kallistasdream", "OS/X": "http://drop.io/kallistasdream", "Source": "http://drop.io/kallistasdream"}, "title": "Kallista's Dream", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d24e08cb2a1cec9778354b02d83d7f33.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/637fdd536e1ed00545ae8f1668f6cad1.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/81b1a4d03db348899e32828f6383389f.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3cbb9ed6b077f65d0a9663e1c3360466.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/86918be566aa348d8693546ef13ffe61.jpg"], "comments": [[null, "KavuDX", null, "Really liked your approach to the theme, but I had one huge problem with the game.

Your goal is the chart as many of of these islands as you can without crashing or running out of supplies. Additional detail is inside the included readme.txt.\nUpdate About Graphics\nIt has come to my attention that the the game is not scaling up properly on some machines. This makes the graphics look extremely blurry, rather than blocky, which was the intent. This may have something to do with XP vs 7; I developed on 7, where it looks fine, but when tried on an XP machine, looked blurry. The game is still playable with the blurry graphics, it just doesn't look good at all (not that it looked \"good\" to start with, but you get me). As I alluded in my release notes below, I'm pretty much unavailable today (Sunday), so this is not something I'll be able to even try to fix. That's the problem with cutting an already short development time in half: little to no time spent testing or bug-fixing. I fully expect to be harshly down-graded by anyone who plays with the blurry graphics, as I should be. I suppose I'll have to chalk this one up to \"lessons learned\" and do better the next time. Sorry!\nNotes\nMade using Game Maker 8. My first time using it actually, though I have used previous versions in the past. I'm actively trying to learn some other game programming, namely C#/XNA and Objective-C/Cocos2D, but those are a long ways away from being something I enter any sort of competition with. This is my second LD attempt, with Caverns being the first. I was not even close to properly prepared for that one in retrospect; I didn't even start Friday night, and goofed around a bit on Saturday, before realizing Sunday morning that I was in trouble. I wound up with about a 66% completed game that was about 33% of my original vision. I wanted to really try at the next one, but after months of waiting, I gut punched when I found out that Exploration was taking place on the weekend I was moving. Arg!\nBut hey, there's always next time right? Believe it or not, I was screwed again: this weekend, I had to fly out mid-day Sunday for business over the next couple of days. Unbelievable! I swear that four out of five weekends, I just hang around the house with nothing special to do. But for some reason, LD conspires against me. I was all set to skip out yet again, when I decided, screw it, I'm going to at least TRY. I scaled back all ideas I had to the bare minimum possible: an Atari-esque arcade game. Something with no music, leaves-plenty-to-the-imagination graphics, play time of under a minute, and so on. And I made it! In retrospect, the game is actually incredibly basic for the amount of time I spent on it - I have a feeling the more experienced people on here could whip this thing out in hours, rather than a full day - but hey, everyone's got to start somewhere, eh?", "author": "MJG", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-17/?action=preview&uid=1169", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6220962/Games/LD17/cartograph.zip", "Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6220962/Games/LD17/cartograph_source.zip"}, "title": "Cartograph", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ec202e3a4209a21b711ed3da019d0a50.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d87421d7bca107ef3c4dcf883b88420c.jpg"], "comments": [[null, "nesgaard", null, "Couldn't get it to behave with Wine :/"], [null, "kintkingle", null, "very ineligible, which made it very hard to play for me. sorry"], [null, "zdanielz", null, "Although rather simplistic design, it is pretty fun to play.
