We had a lot of fun making it, but it was a real challenge!  If you'd like to see how we progressed, check out http://ryanhallcs.wordpress.com/category/ludum-dare-19/ for a blog roll.\nIn this game, you are a young lad going out to sea alone for the first time.  You control a boat and particpate in several quests to discover more about the island... and yourself!\nWe didn't quite finish; there is still some place-holder art and some features were not added in (for example, the reference to sharks or the ability to fire your cannon).  Hopefully the skills we learned and adapted will help us complete the next challenge on time.\nAnyway, we hope you enjoy playing the game!

Move all the way to the right of the map and pick up the Walljump medication.  Walljump up the blocks and go to your left, to the shaft you passed earlier.  Walljump up the shaft and pick up the Skid medication.  Walljump to the alcove in the left of the shaft.  While holding X, jump up (tap UP twice) without holding any other arrow keys).  You should slide onto the ledge to your right.  While holding X, jump over the gaps.  (One of the blocks actually has a messed-up bounding box, so you'll have to jump earlier).  Pick up the rocketjump upgrade to your right.\nAfter getting the rocketjump upgrade, jump over the edge to your left and hold DOWN to charge it.  You should shoot straight up and enter a little alcove with the Brush medication inside.  Then rocketjump down the central tunnel that you walljumped up earlier.\nGo to your left through the brush and down the mini-maze thing.  Go to your right and jump off, holding DOWN to charge up your rocketjump.\nThis part takes some skill; you should reach an L shaped block when you jump up.  Hug the wall and press UP to walljump off of it (but don't hold RIGHT; that'll kill your speed).  Hold X and skid across the platforms.  Make sure to jump on the last platform too.  As soon as you jump off the second platform, hold DOWN to charge up your rocketjump and land in the tunnel.  You should end up going straight up.  When you reach the upper-left corner, walljump off of it (again, not holding LEFT) and hold X to skid across the blocks.\nSkid as far to the right as you can until you reach a bottle of medication.  Pick that up.  Lastly, rocketjump up the shaft again, go down the mini-maze, rocketjump off the ledge to your left, and go through the tunnel that was closed up earlier to get the last bottle of medication.", "author": "an exciting or unusual experience (source: Merriam", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3051", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/971393/Trip.swf", "Web": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/971393/Trip.swf", "Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/971393/Trip_source.zip"}, "title": "Trip (n.)", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d243921e46bbee7063b5711b8a27099d.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/59b1a8a8da61b482108b94ed69079247.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/aed2da988e679d087b8b346d0f2b48a2.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 20, 2010 @ 6:39am", "Epskampie", "3516", "Wow, that was pretty trippy, and hard, i liked it, good job!"], ["Dec 20, 2010 @ 3:17pm", "Moops", "3105", "I managed to reach the fourth battery before my rocketjump boosted me through a wall and out of the level though."], ["Dec 20, 2010 @ 4:59pm", "ThatSnail", "3051", "Controls are very frustrating."], ["Dec 20, 2010 @ 8:40pm", "Sos", "1405", "@Epskampie:"], ["Dec 20, 2010 @ 9:42pm", "DeathBySnail", "2507", "Thanks, glad you liked it.

Coding this game was quite an intense experience, with many dirty short-cuts that needed to be taken as the deadline loomed ever closer.\nCorners were cut pretty early in day two, soon resorting to whole sides being lopped off the project by evening. My greatest regret is that I didn't get to add sound to the project.\nI'm not expecting this game to be judged well, but the competition was an awesome personal challenge and hopefully my next LD will be of competitive quality. This was an awesome experience, and the guys in irc were a fun bunch.\nOh and for those that read the source: Forgive me my sins.\nUPDATE:\nWindows version created, the port required me to fix a stack over flow error. I have included a bug fix version of my original linux submission. Game play for all three versions of the game is identical.\nKnown Bugs:\n- The maze generator breaks about 1 in 10 maze generations, and produces false walls. I would have hoped the bug was rare enough to not affect most peoples game play, but those it did affect assumed it was part of the discovery theme (it's a feature!)\n- I left some console debug info in by mistake, which could help you escape a floor if only you knew the co-ordinates where you started.\n- Rooms all look similar, not enough bodies etc. are all due to everything being generated by an unbiased random number generator. Bodies spawn with a 1 in 3 chance per room, and each room contains either a pick-axe, rail track, or crystal at a random orientation.

Movement skill will affect how high could you jump and how well will you control your character in the air(very useful in this game).\nHint: Plan where to discover and get prepared for the randomized result!", "author": "Spotlightor", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3035", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LandOfDiscovery_src.zip", "OS/X(Bug fixed)": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LandOfDiscovery.app.zip", "Web(Bug fixed)": "http://spotlightor.com/lab/unity3d/ld19", "Windows(Bug fixed)": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/651996/LandOfDiscovery.zip"}, "title": "Land of Discovery", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/aef5fd2d46f408282664b66083d56b04.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1ca05327d48e7fed7447260a857311d0.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/939f74a0a5113b72e2e7674857b96cd9.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5ef20daf3e89deee3cfa05b377540b19.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/cc68770719bd81a7672283564bc283e0.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 21, 2010 @ 12:11am", "ranklar", "3268", "You got my hopes up... and then I found the bugs... so I ended up apparently in a weird state on the first catwalk section I discovered...

{"ratings": {"Coolness": ["2%", 150]}, "description": "Snowboggan! is a 3d flash game.  I've always wanted to write a toboggan simulator, where you can speed down a snowy hill on a sled, dodging trees and smashing into snowmen.  This weekend's game jams finally gave me the chance.  Check it out!  I would love to read your comments and warmly encourage you to let me know what you think.\nUse the arrow keys to go left and right, and try to take out as many snowmen as you can!\nIn this game, you are immortal.  It was created for fun, and no matter what happens you can always climb back to the top of the hill and start again.  There is a hint of danger, however: if you smash into a tree or hit the thin ice signs, you might get flipped over!  If you do get flipped over, simply hit the [Click to restart] button on the top left.\nThe objective of the game is to \"discover\" gravity, prove that snowmen are not at all \"immortal\", and avoid the \"thin ice\" while gravity is constantly \"drawing\" you to the bottom of the hill.  These words have quotes around them because those were the secret theme words for the game jams I participated in.\nThis game was programmed using FlashDevelop for a pure as3 project, compiled using Flex, and the engines are away3d for graphics, jiglib for physics and Flint for particle effects.  All sounds were created by me using a microphone.  The guitar and snow sounds were done with my hands and mouth, and the sliding snow sound was the microphone rubbing up against my winter jacket.  It was an absolute blast to program and I learned a lot.  Thanks for playing.

I edited the post above a while ago to say that you should start the first level with the spacebar. I sort of assumed it was commonly used in keyboard-based gameplay, and that people would try it sooner rather than later. As for the enemies: most of them just bounce around randomly, but if you hit them with a Ping, they tend to get a bit faster, at least temporarily. At least, that's what I was aiming for. Some of them, however, will home in one you, but only if you A) Ping them, or B) switch on a light switch. The former method of alerting them will cause them stop homing if you can avoid them for ten seconds. I considered limiting pings, but I eventually cam to the conclusion that it should be a trade-off: Being able to see or being safe. I hope that that came across, at least in the later levels.

So this is is basically meaningless.)\nYrevoc Sid--a planet within the Goldilocks zone of its mother star. Circa 2031, humankind turned its telescopes to examine it. Life, it appeared, existed (and perhaps even flourished) on this world. It boasted an atmosphere identical to Earth's, and water lay across nearly seventy percent of its surface. Scientists began planning missions to investigate this planet, with the ultimate goal of determining just how much life there was. But the third World War interrupted this potential discovery.\nAll research was diverted to the various war efforts. Invented were vast numbers of missiles, satellites, and firearms. Yrevoc Sid was soon forgotten. It was by lucky chance that the nuclear phase-out program had been completed two months prior to the war's beginning; humanity could have easily made itself extinct. After the resolution of this three-decade war, a global government was formed. What was once military technology was now pointed to the stars.\nLush, wild planets were quickly found. They were more plentiful than any pre-war scientist had ever dreamed. However, one thing that was never found was sentient life. No planet showed any signs of civilization. Therefore, it entered the common wisdom that humans were the only species to bear this remarkable trait.\nAfter decades of this era of faster-than-light space travel passed, a researcher had a hunch. Back on the now insignificant, war-torn Earth. A man by the name of Robert Case had found the records of Yrevoc Sid. Case observed a discrepancy--recent scans of the planet had revealed very little water, and absolutely no signs of life. He found it odd that a planet should seem so lush before the war, but truly be so barren. Obviously, a research grant would never be issued to persue a trifling misalignment like this, so the researcher set out on his own, unfunded and under the radar.\nRobert Case returned to humankind a hero.", "author": "31eee384", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=1712", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Source": "http://www.galacticgaming.net/hosting/ludum/ld19/LD19_src_YrevocSid.zip", "Web (Applet, Jam version)": "http://galacticgaming.net/ys/bin/pl.html", "Download (Executable Jar)": "http://www.galacticgaming.net/hosting/ludum/ld19/dist/YrevocSid.jar", "Download (Executable Jar, Linux, no sound)": "http://galacticgaming.net/ys/dist/YrevocSid_linux_nosound.jar", "Web (Applet)": "http://www.galacticgaming.net/hosting/ludum/ld19/bin/pl.html"}, "title": "Mystery of Yrevoc Sid", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7d69a8e1470c29296cdce5bcf0cc8854.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 20, 2010 @ 4:34am", "LegacyCrono", "3093", "Stunning idea!

For the three days to work on this jam, I had about 3 hours each day for coding.  Josh who did the art did a kick ass job.  I wish I had more time to code to really make use of all the great artwork he did.  (minus the ugly flame sprite, I did that at the last second, so don't blame Josh!)\nSo basically this game loads and you hit space to go through the title, credits, and story boards.  Once in the main game you select two alien coins to switch places to try to get 3 or more coins in a row.  The radiation symbol was suppose to deal damage to the alien you are competing against, but that didn't make it into the game.\nI didn't get time to do the Alien AI, so you basically just get to have fun getting rid of coins and such until you get bored.  But we felt in the spirit of the Jam, we should upload what we have finished.\nThe game was coded in Visual C++, using SDL for portability. Graphics were done with Photoshop.  Sound effects were done with sfxr.\nWe are going to finish the game as we have time to work on it.  For the finished game we will furnish binaries for Windows , Linux and Mac.\nThe Jam was a lot of fun and we look forward to the next one, and hope to have more time for it.\nMike & Josh", "author": "deathtongue", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=3151", "entry_type": ["Game Jam Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.hillsoftware.com/worldrisk.rar"}, "title": ".World at Risk", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d7ebd4e64ea132b064d39103967c8b62.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b2f09e92c4b93ad82b894e9ee42b093b.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/861a549176926b6e391b8cf920c4b97e.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8d5e8229163b681e30b5da329c131603.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 21, 2010 @ 7:21am", "viMaster", "3150", "Awesome!"]], "images": [{"url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d7ebd4e64ea132b064d39103967c8b62.jpg", "path": "full/9d3d04afb41da76c256d8b381fce4939953cfb7c.jpg", "checksum": "7bce386b2c62214d93577f68974f05ef"}, {"url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b2f09e92c4b93ad82b894e9ee42b093b.jpg", "path": "full/da270a970cecf3d5d1422c6bdfdaca8777639fc8.jpg", "checksum": "e1806ee280d92924ea633318e0242f6b"}, {"url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/861a549176926b6e391b8cf920c4b97e.jpg", "path": "full/68d4114e71801b2b54d16b2e9cee09b004c1d1b3.jpg", "checksum": "dfb66f809e59027b456d3c0a7c6bec21"}, {"url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8d5e8229163b681e30b5da329c131603.jpg", "path": "full/e3e046b3492bd4b04bee8c295b2e3a3c3171c68a.jpg", "checksum": "abbad773b8db2bb12986140800f042fd"}]}

Which at times it was, but others not so much.\nThis is the first time I've ever made a racing game (as it's probably quite easy to tell) and so I decided to try and keep it similar to one of my all time favourites Indy 500 (Atari 2600) as even with it's extremely simplistic nature it could keep you entertained. So I tried a similar approach.\nSadly I had a lot go wrong on me especially last minute (as it always happens then) which has caused my entry to only have on piece of sound sadly, making this my first entry that lacks on sound. As well as that my art isn't as good as it could be, and I spent no time on the tracks. Also after testing the file uploading works I noticed the vehicles could have been sped down a little.\nOverall though I do enjoy playing it, and I'm happy with how it turned out, needs a bit of tweaks here and there and a load of polish and I'll be very happy with it.\nAnywho to keep with the feel of Indy 500 I've made it available for multiple people to play (and sadly the one player is only one track due to lots of problems) so you can play on your own or have 2-4 players, the instructions screen shows the controls which consist of a variety of keyboard buttons.\nThere is no end to the game, just have some fun racing round the laps.\nLand Rover Discovery Challenge was made in Game Maker 8 and has been tested on Windows 7 (64bit)", "author": "Catmoo", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=1396", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.catmoo.co.uk/land_rover_discovery_challenge_by_catherine_woolley.zip", "Source": "http://www.catmoo.co.uk/land_rover_discovery_challenge_source.zip"}, "title": "Land Rover Discovery Challenge", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/bbe0e9ea472ac331d1554b98f0173a51.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7104ddf47f847cdfd2dcabf220a324a6.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3b02a68d1f86000645582f0b7ff72bfc.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 23, 2010 @ 3:18am", "ranklar", "3268", "Ok, so no end seems silly.

When you wish to make your move click the End Turn button.\nWhen your hero is on your home base you can transfer units from your base to your hero by clicking on the base (try to click on the part exposed behind your hero).

Seeking fortunes galore, despite your old age, you set off to find said gold.\nUnfortunately due to poor eyesight and a slight senility, you find yourself, not in California, but in Costa-Rica! (Disclaimer; randomly generated foliage may or may not represent that of Costa-Rica).

I also highly recommend you read the manual, I put a lot of hard work into it! Also, due to the randomized nature of this game, some levels are very hard whereas others are very easy, so be forewarned!\nI realize the use of the theme is very vague; the original concept was randomly generated ores (they still are) with random stats (not any more) that you could craft stuff with, so you'd be constantly discovering new exciting ores. (the only relic from that phase is the random colors). So when I had to change the whole idea of the game, I didn't have much time to re-incorporate it. The Theme lives on however in the story: you've uncovered a bountiful deposit of new metals; go get-em!\nSo yeah, I hope you enjoy the game, I certainly enjoyed making it (most of the time), and I'll see you all for the voting phase!\nEDIT: I forgot an important thing in the manual:\nKNOWN BUGS:\nsometimes the \"RETURN TO SURFACE\" thing just doesn't appear.\nEDIT2:\nuploaded a new version where ores no longer spawn in the walls, as this rendered the game unplayable 50% of the time.", "author": "moltanem2000", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-19/?action=preview&uid=1548", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Source (2.61 MB)": "http://www.mediafire.com/?7k28c8rktxu7eyc", "Windows (3.79 MB)": "http://www.mediafire.com/?xcsqpkmbywj17ff"}, "title": ":ORE:", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4e17386f1d457713a8a10c97d77e3a9e.jpg"], "comments": [["Dec 20, 2010 @ 5:03am", "FireSlash", "3130", "Great start, you should finish this one.

Due to the version of SFML I use, you may get an error from vshost32 - this is a known problem but doesn't appear to be dangerous.\nThis game is way way unfinished. There are only three dialogs and a map with about a dozen different tiles, still, you might find it interesting for a few minutes.\nI'm disappointed that I completed very little actual game, on the other hand, not only did I actually attempt it, I completed several thousand lines of engine code. There are actually only around 6 lines of code in the engine that are specific to The Complex.
