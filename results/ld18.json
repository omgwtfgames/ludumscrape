The theme was \"Enemies as Weapons\". Development took 26 hours from August 20th-22nd, 2010.\nDESCRIPTION:\nYou control a robot attempting to lure enemy seekers and spikes into mines before the mines explode. The difficulty ramps up as you destroy mines. You can build your chain multiplier for huge points. Chain resets when you take damage or let a mine explode. With each increase in difficulty there is a multiplier that will keep buffing your score.\nPROTIP:\nSend wall spikes into mines instead of using the seekers all the time--the base points are worth 5x as much!\nNOTE:\nAVOIDAL is a \"mouse skills\" type game so it was designed to be played with a mouse (or tablet perhaps.) It will be a lot harder to score well on a trackpad--sorry!\nTOOLS USED:\nFlash CS4 with ActionScript 3.0, Photoshop CS4, SFXR, Reason\nFEEDBACK:\nI really appreciate constructive feedback--especially about game balance and difficulty issues! I'll be using this feedback to release the post-compo final version.\nThanks so much for your time playing my game!", "author": "HybridMind", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=234", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Source": "http://avoidal.com/avoidal-source.zip", "Web": "http://avoidal.com/compo.html", "Gameplay Trailer": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH0AL9sNrro", "Post-Compo Version": "http://avoidal.com"}, "title": "AVOIDAL", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1371bb3d2e54c113a8e7676e6ac0ff2f.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ac227768deee0a69bd161da908f637b5.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a6c70a9ca47128b7fe316e5ee5271440.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a5696bb22511abb13c369d9f7679f414.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/plugins/compo2/images/igold.gif", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/plugins/compo2/images/ibronze.gif"], "comments": [["Aug 23, 2010 @ 6:18am", "devinmoore", "2506", "Strong concept, well implemented.

You can collect only 12 out of 14 nests, but since nothing happens in the end, i guess it doesn't matter.", "author": "Sos", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=1405", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Web": "http://so0os.pl/ld18/play.html", "Source": "http://so0os.pl/ld18/haha.zip"}, "title": "Fight Chickens With Chickens", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8f6962c89e6d60a80fc748c5300b78b4.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/d4c4ab9d5581be68ca9255bd4e8a7f9e.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 23, 2010 @ 12:21am", "TheLastBanana", "2656", "I liked this one.

Double click to drop the mine in your current location, double click to remove it from anywhere.\nApparently some people have experienced really slow animation.

Okay, well, maybe IE9.\nPart of the plan for this game was to do something totally cross-platform with HTML/Javascript, and ideally this sort of thing will run on an iPad or N900. I have only tested it in Firefox, Chrome and Opera and it seems to run well.\nDeveloped in Linux with GIMP, Gedit, etc. Had to dust off my old WinXP box to run an ancient copy of Reason to do the music (the box of which I'll still need to try out everyone else's stuff!!)

There was a problem with the PySFML 1.6 download for windows, compiled it from source and the game should work now.\nA puzzle game, featuring zombies. Don't let anybody escape to the safehouses. With two enemy types.\nShambler: your basic human enemy, as soon as they can hear a zombie within 3 tiles of them they start to move towards the nearest safehouse. If they get there then you fail in your mission.\nSniper: trained soldiers, although they can kill your zombies, you can get back at them, as years of sitting around waiting for something to happen have removed their ability to turn 180 degrees, so if you can get behind them then you can transform them easily and when they are on your side, you can use their rifle to kill far away enemies.\nThe zombies in this game were caused by some mysterious magical force, they can resurrect the dead corpses of slain humans. A dead zombie however, remains dead.\nControls:\n*  left click on a zombie to select it\n*  right click on a tile to path towards it\n*  press the spacebar or end turn button to advance 1 turn\n*  as a sniper, right click on an enemy to shoot.\n*  press R to restart the level if you get stuck\nOnly managed to finish making three levels in the end, but probably will add more in a post compo version. When you get past the third level you will just get a plain level with one enemy in the corner. There are level creation tools built in but they are not particularly well designed. Read below for info on how to use them.\nReally enjoyed this competition and hope to take part in future ludum dares.\nHere is how to create your own level:\n* Press E to enter the tile editor. Press one to use wall tiles and press zero to use floor tiles, click to paint\n* Press C to enter the collision editor, paint over the walls by clicking on them to make them colidable.\n* Press H to enter the entity placement editor, press 0 to place shamblers, 1 to place safehouses and 2 to place snipers. With shamblers and snipers, left click gets you a zombie and left click and shift gets you a sniper. After using the entity placement editor press R as this restarts the level and makes sure your entities will show up when you play.\n* Press P to play.\n* To save the level, press S.\n* If you need to skip forward to your level when you start up the game U skips forwards one level.", "author": "Andrew Marsh", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2437", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10426165/zombie-conquest-win.zip", "Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10426165/zombie-conquest-src.zip"}, "title": "Zombie Conquest", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c09f8994b4b83f41205f8f30cca45b1f.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/a1eedf3a2c78796be928f6851005b34d.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 23, 2010 @ 5:18am", "Chickenwing", "2454", "I could only start the game once."], ["Aug 23, 2010 @ 5:21am", "Chickenwing", "2454", "And ran into the safe house and lost."], ["Aug 23, 2010 @ 5:29am", "Andrew Marsh", "2437", "Seems ok, but takes a bit long with the rounds."], ["Aug 23, 2010 @ 6:06am", "Andrew Marsh", "2437", "One easy start/tutorial level that is fast to play had been nice."], ["Aug 23, 2010 @ 11:18am", "Jhelle", "2232", "Ok the start once was my fault..."], ["Aug 24, 2010 @ 2:45am", "pdyxs", "2440", "Chickenwing, could you try running it in compatablity mode for windows 98, for some reason the game crashes randomly on Windows Vista and Windows 7 if you do not do this."], ["Aug 24, 2010 @ 4:07am", "Andrew Marsh", "2437", "And about tutorial levels.

But being this far behind was depressing... and knowing that I couldn't update my LD progress and participate with the rest of the community... or possibly even SUBMIT the game... I didn't have much enthusiasm. Plus I was super tired yet again and only worked on my idea for about an hour.\nSunday, August 22nd, 2010\nTHE FINAL DAY. STILL NO INTERNET.\nSo I toiled away for about 4 hours and ended up with a little tech demo and nothing else.\nIt's not a game, and I didn't even have time to implement enemies. Only the weapons that were ONCE enemies. This is like seeing the sequel before the prequel. It doesn't translate well.\nI still had a chance at the jam, though... so I decided to slap some SFX and music into the game very quickly... with an intent to cram some more programming in on Monday night.\nMonday, August 23rd, 2010\nHAD TO WORK LATE AGAIN. The internet was finally fixed when I got home, so I spent another hour or so catching up on the LD site and prepping my tech demo for an upload. Didn't have time to add anything new, so I didn't even bother.\nAnd there you have it... my LD 18 time line. OH JOYOUS JOY. I missed it all, and that sucks. I love seeing game previews on Friday and Saturday, then playing the end result on Sunday. It's the best part of Ludum Dare, if you ask me.\nMAN SUCKS AND BLOWS\n-------------------\nUse your enemies as weapons!

{"ratings": {"Coolness": ["13%", 55]}, "description": "Hello! Me and my friend Pete made this game below in 70ish hours, from scratch in Delphi.\nMARCH OF THE RORGERS - HOW TO PLAY\n==================================\nPREMISE\n-------\nBobbing up and down at the top of the screen is the blue Orb. Defend it at all costs. It is surrounded by four laser towers which provide some limited defence. HOWEVER! Those towers alone are nowhere near powerful enough on their own to halt the march of the Rorgers. Instead, you will have to rely on the building abilities of the little crab-like Builder Bot sitting in your base. The key is to turn the enemies against each other. Here's how:\nBUILD MENU\n----------\nCommands are executed mainly through the Build Menu, which is accessed by clicking anywhere on the terrain (except for the Orb). There are three types of command, and executing multiple commands in quick succession will cause the commands to be queued up.\n-SALVAGE-\nYour Builder Bot is capable of collecting resources from the land. Rocks and buildings can be salvaged by clicking on them in the terrain and selecting the 'GET' icon. Resources are important; without them there's only a limited amount that you can build. You can see how many you have in the top right corner of the screen.\n-SIGNS-\nYour bot is capable of building four types of signs pointing up, down, left and right. Each sign costs 10 resources and you may only build 3 signs per builder bot you have in your possession. Click where you would like to build and the build menu will appear. Select the sign you want from it, and your bot will go to work.\nA sign may not be placed directly near another sign; when the build menu is up you will see a red radius around locations where you cannot build.\n-DESTROY-\nClicking on a sign and then the hammer icon will send your Builder Bot to destroy it, for when it is no longer useful or you need to free up sign slots.\nTHE ORB\n-------\nThe Orb that you are guarding is a special case, as clicking on it gives you the chance to build an extra Builder Bot. Having extra builders is good because it increases your sign limit and allows more commands to be executed simultaneously, but it comes at the relatively hefty price of 50 resources.\nTHE RORGERS\n-----------\nThere are 3 different types of Rorgers; Stress Rorgers (Red), Envy Rorgers (Green) and Fear Rorgers (Black). All have the common goal of destroying your Orb but different types of Rorgers do not get along. You must use this to your advantage by guiding them into conflict with each other via the signs you build.\nRorgers begin at the bottom of the screen, emerging from their deployment tubes, and work their way upward before converging on your base.\nSigns will cause Rorgers to change direction when encountered, but they will not be fooled forever. After a while, unless they encounter another sign they will realise they have been led astray and head back towards your orb.\nIMPORTANT: Each Rorger will only be fooled by the same sign once, so don't expect the same trick to work twice.\nYou can see on the right side of the screen a chart that indicates which type of Rorger will attack which. But be warned: this may change occasionally as a result of the volatile Rorger political situation that is beyond our comprehension.\nTIP: Be wary of those sneaky Fear Rorgers - they like to attack your base from the sides!\n---\nGood Luck, and we hope you enjoy the game!\nLove from,\nSurprised Man", "author": "Spleeny", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2392", "entry_type": ["Game Jam Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.halofan.co.uk/projects/rorgers/Release.zip"}, "title": "March of the Rorgers", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/12d0b9a479f28cbed1bd46bc3962c6f7.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/3fa1a6c062ff68502747a18c3020a8dc.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/797b8ddca1df229e1a714b000fe6936d.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/6903f5a3475db13a938c803ba3650056.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/42912e6bf71febd4872f7a2299e03340.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 27, 2010 @ 9:56pm", "able_to_think", "2753", "Good job guys!

IT WAS CRAZY!\nI will never think to myself, \"That's all they could do in 48 hours?\" ever again. Phew!\nLet me just say, I really only had 24 hours to work on this competition. For the entire first day I was learning Actionscript 3 and the Flixel library as I had never really used either before. I spent that time doing tutorials and such and really only began working on my game around 10pm Saturday, or 24 hours in. See the time lapse if you don't believe me! :P\nAnyway, I am entering my game in the competition, but to be fair I'm not sure it even qualifies as a game seeing as you cannot win. Or perhaps I am just sadistic, haha.\nWhat you will experience when you play the game is the beginning of an idea, and concept for the theme \"enemies as weapons.\" The idea is you are an alien parasite who controls humans, but they can only survive so long with you in their body. You will notice that the life counter turns red at different periods for different humans. This is because I wanted to implement a mechanic where humans would start to attack you once you showed signs of infection (once the number turns red). Well, really only the army guy would attack you.\nAlso, I was going to make it so outside of a different pain tolerance (level when you start to show signs of infection), each human had a special ability. The army guy could shoot, medic could heal others (to help you reuse them easier), and the tech could use computers which would open doors. Combined I thought these mechanics plus some good level design would go together to make some pretty cool levels and an overall nifty idea.\nI definitely plan to further flesh out this idea after I rest from the weekend, and hope to have a much more polished and playable version available in the near future.\nA HUGE thanks to everyone from the Ludum Dare community, and also to the people in the #flixel channel on freenode. They were a big help while learning the library. I look forward to the next LD48 in 4 months.\nTake care,\nItzMattu\nhttp://gdg.uml.edu", "author": "itzmattu", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&uid=2543", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Web": "http://www.swfcabin.com/open/1282531885", "Timelapse": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFa_tFzUDvo", "Source": "http://www.itzmattu.com/LD18.zip"}, "title": "Alien Parasite", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/eb211f8973542d5402af167031669b32.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/96f665d640820e57d3eb90e8b466570a.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 22, 2010 @ 11:43pm", "TheLastBanana", "2656", "Looks cool!

So as Ace Disguise Master you defeat enemies and as you do you learn how to disguise as them. When disguised as an enemy you gain their abilities. By the way Ace is so elusive about his identity that he starts the game disguised as a yellow blorber thingy enemy. Can you get through the 6 stages alive?

You have no weapons or drilling equipment, and so must use your trusty tractor beam to defend yourself.  GO FOR THE KILL SCREEN!\nArrow keys move, pressing and holding Z activates your tractor beam.  The beam is auto targeting and will grab the nearest enemy.  While the beam is on, it is locked at a specific length.\nTechnical notes: This was made using the following libraries: Box2d, OpenGL, SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer.  It was compiled on a Mac using XCode for the Mac version, and compiled on a Mac using a mingw port of g++ for the Windows version.  I have included the original source and the updated source for the PC port.  The only difference is that I changed the c files specifically to cpp files (I was compiling them as such in the Xcode project but I didn't want the hassle when dealing with g++) and changed the mix channels to 2 (4 was causing a crash for some reason)).  I have included the Windows makefile but I don't even know where to get that mingw toolchain anymore, so I can't really provide support there, however, if you want to compile it for windows on a windows machine, I can probably help you get set up.  If you get the game compiling, and it doesn't work when you try to run it, remember it requires some game assets that are available in the game zip file.  Also remember it requires SDL, SDL_image, and SDL_mixer, so you may need to install the runtime libraries or include them in the app file (Mac) or the project directory (Windows).\n(Dev notes: Procrastinated too much, especially considering that I decided mid-development to try implementing Box2d for the first time.  It was actually very easy to add and use but it cost me time.  I still like the game, and I hope you all do too, but I wish I had more enemy types.

I thought I post it anyhow, for interests sake. Note that even though this is in the Jam, I was aiming for a Compo-compliant game, and as far as I can tell it is.\nThe idea for this game was inspired by the old Short Circuit game, and something fiona said on IRC ... \"taking control of robots\". It is common knowledge that all robots are evil and your enemies, so this amounts to using \"enemies as weapons\". So there is you, robots, and terminals that you can use to take control of them. The idea was to use the robots to crash into each other, and also crash through walls to help you exit the level.\nIn it's current state, pressing 'A' button (=Z key) while at a terminal will make a robot run in the direction that was last moving. One terminal is tied to one robot. You can crash two robots together and they die. Most testing was done zoomed out on the map so you could see everything, but for actually playing the game I think it's more fun if you can't see the whole map at one time.
