Le sigh. Still, got some good progress!\nWindows and OS X builds are now up! Enjoy! Also, the windows build should now actually *work*.\nThe idea was the to make a game in the style of Advance Wars or Final Fantasy Tactics, taking place underground, involving warring armies of mole people and, eventually, other underground nasties.\nThe mouse-driven menu system is pretty terrible (as some of the comments below will attest). In fact, nearly every action in the game has a keyboard equivalent for the menu items. Unfortunately, key equivalent assignment is incredibly haphazard, since I ran out of time well before I got to going back and fixing them up. For the main action menu, it's the first letter of the action (M for Move, D for Dig, A for Attack). For choosing a destination square, you must use the mouse (only action in the game that requires the mouse). OK/Cancel is always enter and escape, respectively. Choosing a dig pattern can be done with the number keys (1 for the first pattern, 2 for the second). Choosing a dig direction is the arrow keys, or NWSE for North/south/east/west. Choosing an attack target is the arrow keys.\nI do intend to improve all that, when I continue to work on this in the future. But for the compo voting, unfortunately the controls are pretty terrible. Sorry for that.\nNote also that the source I have posted now is slightly different from what I had posted originally.

Here's the end-result of a lot of learning and not so much gameplay coding!\nMy original goal was to create a pong game inside a cavern, with deformed walls and rocks in the way, mixing things up. I didn't manage to get deformed walls, but at least there's a bunch of rocks to make it a bit different. I didn't of course settle for just any physics simulation, but picked PhysX because there seemed to be a good Ogre wrapper for it (NxOgre). Before this weekend I hadn't done anything with Ogre, PhysX or Blender, so it's been quite a productive learning experience, probably more suited for a MiniLD weekend though... I'm glad I managed to finish even what I have now, because 6 hours ago I only had a falling block on the screen. :)\nCONTROLS:\nLCTRL+LSHIFT: Control the Left Paddle\nDOWN+UP: Control the Right Paddle\nSPACE: Reset\nESC: Exit\nRequirements:\nI've tried to include all the dlls in the package, but you might have to install PhysX if you don't have an NVidia GPU.\nIf nvcuda.dll is missing your PhysX driver might be a bit outdaetd, by googling I got the impression that old drivers didn't include CUDA.\nFor those getting PhysXLoader.dll missing I found this thread http://www.dracula-origin.com/forum-en/viewtopic.php?p=2029 , dunno if it's worth it but you can go through the steps there if you already have PhysX installed. :)\nLibraries used:\nOGRE\nPhysX (NxOgre)\nOIS\nTools used:\nVisual Studio 2008\nBlender (+ some Ogre mesh exporters)\nThe game probably includes many bugs and memory leaks I didn't manage to fix because of time constraints and not knowing what I was doing. :D", "author": "phren", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=238", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://users.tkk.fi/~mmatvein/gamedev/ld15/CavernPong.zip", "Source": "http://users.tkk.fi/~mmatvein/gamedev/ld15/CavernPong_src.zip"}, "title": "Cavern Pong", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/f9c2725bf2c4879dd58c6a6fca87ce88.jpg"], "comments": [[null, "bburbank", null, ":(\n\nThe program can't start because PhysXLoader.dll is mmissing from your computer.

Well, that was fun! Not! No, it was actually.\nI noticed a number of people were a little confused with how to play my entry Brinie, so I thought I would offer a quick guide to the game. It's funny, I just assumed everyone would pick it up through playing it a little bit.\nOk, when the game starts, you should see Brinie, a net, and a bunch of things that look like fleas. These are the Grags. They live to eat, pretty much anything and everything. As Brinie is the only thing out there, you will see them start to chase her around. When they touch her, they begin feeding off of her. When they eat all they can, they will go off and cruise, but not before having a baby.  In this way, very quickly 10 Grags can become 100 Grags and 100 Grags can become 1000 Grags. If enough Grags get to Brinie, they will very quickly kill her off.\nYou have three options to try to save Brinie.\n1) Drop a Gauloop somewhere on the playfield. It is a hive of small noisy creatures. These are like bait. They have a strong smell and may attract Grags away from Brinie. In the same way, Brinie doesn't like the smell of the Gauloop so it may repel her a bit. You can use these to try to get her to go where you want, or if not that, at least keep her away from certain places. The problem with Gauloops is that Grags feed off them and will quickly devour them and cause the ranks of Grags to grow greatly.\n2) Drop a Pauper somewhere on the playfield. A pauper is like a Gauloop, and it has a much stronger smell, but it doesn't feed them nearly as well. What it does do is after a few seconds, it explodes, killing all Grags in the area. If positioned properly, this can be used to wipe out a huge population of Grags. The drawback is that Grags love to eat dead Grags, and a few living Grags will find the carnage a great feasting area and may quickly multiple their ranks back up.\n3) Use your Net to capture Brinie. When Brinie is completely on the net, simply press the capture button and you win the game. The net also has the effect of killing any Grags on it at the time it is pressed. This fact can be used in combination with 1) and 2) to really wipe out the Grags. It is a great and difficult (and not necessary) accomplishment to completely wipe out the Grags, but it is possible and quite a fun challenge.\nNow you are limited to 9 Gauloops, 6 Paupers and 3 Net captures, so use them wisely. Also, you can only have up to 3 gauloops and 1 pauper on the playfield at one time, so that is a consideration as well.\nI used the language Processing for this entry. It was pretty much the first time I tried to use the language for anything. Got to say, I enjoyed it quite a bit.

I uploaded a fixed exe which you should use. Amusingly, if you re-compiled off the source included in the zip, you'd get the correct exe ( which this is ) ... apologies for that! Lack of sleep and being ill really didn't help.\n-- Extra Help For Those Stuck At What To Do --\nThe point of the game is to land on each station in the caves, and Transport the researchers from that point to your main base outside the cave.\nYou do this by landing on the station, pressing down, and X on PC.\nYou'll see your Researchers counter change from ( in the first level ) 0/0/5 to 0/1/4 indicating that you've rescued 0, have 1 in transit, with 4 remaining.\nTransport them to your base outside the caves, land, press down and X again, and your researchers status should change to 1/0/4 - showing you've rescued one, have 0 in transit with 4 remaining.\nIf a station has no more researchers left, it dims ( and the landing pad's hazard lines go from yellow to red. )\nEach station you land at also restrengthens your shield if they're active ( you can speed this up by holding down ), and marks a respawn point, so should you die, you'll respawn there rather than on your base.\nYou can also transport a researcher back to a station - main point of doing this is if you need to top up your shield after going too deep into the caves, and still too far from your main base.\nOnce you rescue/kill ( if you die with a researcher in transit, they die too ) all researchers on that sector, you'll get a \"GET OFF THE MOON\" message, to which just fly outside the cave and straight up, or to the left. You'll then be taken to either the next sector of that moon, or the next moon if you've completed all 5 sectors.\n-- Survival Hints --\nAlthough killing everything in sight is good for points, some sectors are tight on time, and your main task is to save those researchers! Your best best is finding them all and moving them to a station near the exit first, and then blasting everything to bits.\nBe warned that if the timer comes under 75 units, the moon starts to destabalise, making it trickier to see what's going on as the timer ticks ever closer to zero.\nHope that helps those confused as to what's going on!\n-- Stuckie", "author": "stuckie", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-15/?action=preview&uid=267", "entry_type": ["Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Fixed Win32 Binary": "http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk/gamez/ludumdare/ld15/SGZ2D.exe", "Dingoo A320": "http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk/gamez/ludumdare/ld15/MoonsOfSubterraneLD15-Dingoo.7z", "Windows/Linux(AMD64)/Source": "http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk/gamez/ludumdare/ld15/MoonsOfSubterrane-LD15.7z", "GP2X-Wiz": "http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk/gamez/ludumdare/ld15/MoonsOfSubterraneLD15-Wiz.7z"}, "title": "Moons Of Subterrane", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c71b554c54b99c02a9a36b2007ab6ee0.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/127e62c49a467bc37b3042128e3f4b21.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2678265e97f7a83950e0986077ac891d.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ffeeba2daf4603f854ecdfcbb4f43e89.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/plugins/compo2/images/isilver.gif"], "comments": [[null, "ol_h", null, "Seems to run way, way, way too fast on my machine.

I also found it strange that I was being killed by mushrooms as for some reason I wasn't expecting that mechanic and it took me a little to figure out why I was getting FAIL screens away from boulders or dinos.  \n\nI eventually walled myself in accidentally on like level 8 or 9 and the spacebar didn't seem to work to restart the level.\n\nSeemed a bit easy to figure out the basic strategy being to quickly cut off the dino path, harvest all mushrooms, then make a hole in path to let dinos come after you while the mole rat doubles back to the now free entrance.  I feel like that strategy makes the game less fun once you discover that.  Perhaps there should be a way that the dinos can slowly bore a path too so that the player can't tarry long?  I feel that would ratchet up the tension perhaps and add some more kick to the gameplay if you couldn't just take your time.  If you use different antagonists then dinos (perhaps something that could bore through the boulders) that would lead to more exciting gameplay.\n\nEnjoyed the music and the graphics.

Once I learned how to navigate and correctly read the water the game became a lot more fun messing around with relative displacements of space and dirt as well as strategically using a bomb.  A mechanic I love is that you can use the bomb to stop water following you but it comes at the cost of creating an impenetrable wall after the fact.  That is a very nice touch.

No need to tap button.\n- You generate more lift when you aren't moving left or right. Just flap without a direction and you will fly upward.

The perlin-noise plus some levels of convolution works well to make nice cavernous maps,. so I use that here.  Next I wanted to have some lighting effects as well as a way to give the AIs limited vision.  So I did a brute-force raycasting lighting setup,. and most of the workflow slowdown came from figuring where to store what data and how to pass it between things,. as I normaly just stick with the model structure built into ZGE and in this case the 'map' is an array that is drawn from a single model.
