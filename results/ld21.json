The full text of what you have to type is displayed along the bottom. Along the top is your text entry box and the word you should type next. The second mode is called \"Nyan mode\" where you just type nyan over an over again until you become sick of it (or make 4 mistakes). The third mode is the one that most resembles an actual game, it's called Fish mode. Type the words that appear on the fish to destroy them, partly inspired by Typing of the Dead.\nIf you have kids, it might be something they could play.

Sometimes they would decide to run in circles forever instead of shooting (a couple times I had an enemy run into me and just keep running instead of try to shoot) and sometimes they'd run out of the room and not come back. Because I never figured out things like what would make enemies likely to start shooting at me or not, what would make them more or less likely to be able to hit me, even where they were aiming or their bullets were landing most of the time, or what the rules were for when the \"Alarm\" would restart after 30 seconds vs stopping... because of all this whether I got through any one situation felt like mostly a matter of luck. Meanwhile, since in a lot of the rooms I *could* get through just by charging through and hoping I didn't get shot, I felt like I didn't have a lot of incentive to play \"correctly\" vs barreling through. Some of the rooms looked like they had interesting level geometry to them that could be used to get through by stealth, but it seemed like if I tried to play that way I'd be increasing the chances a random AI behavior would kill me whereas if I just ran for the exits eventually I'd get a run where the enemy would either miss me or voluntarily run out of the room or something.

One obvious thing that would help a lot is a save function.

There was this <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/uQxU1.png\">one room</a> that didn't seem to serve a gameplay function, but looking at it it was easy to imagine a version of the game where if you're in \"alarm\" mode the enemies can chase you into the next room, and then you'd need rooms like this one (full of nice big hiding places) in order to lose them."], ["Aug 27, 2011 @ 10:31am", "localcoder", "1113", "I ran into a handful of bugs, but only one big one.

Due to the way it's coded, bullets are only destroyed when they exit the screen or hit an enemy. Firing loads of bullets can lag the game. Fire in single or double bursts for best gameplay - as few bullets as possible at a time.\n2. Bullets have faster speeds when you fire with the cursor more towards the edge of the game field - to avoid the bullet clean-up problem mentioned in number (1), try to fire as far out as possible (again, in single or double bursts).\n3. Also due to the coding, only the most recent bullet fired will have collision. This can cause problems in clean-up (for example creating a bullet shield at slow speed means those bullets will not be cleaned up as they will not get to the edge of the screen or hit an enemy) and may confuse gameplay. For the best advice, I'd say that sticking to single or double shots will help in all cases (again).\nTL;DR:\nFire as few bullets as possible, aiming as close to the edge of the screen (or the enemy you wish to kill) as possible, to get best performance and (hopefully) enjoyment.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nPlease do feed back.

(To do this, press \"p\" to pick up or drop the bomb).\nDevelopment\n-----------\nBombusaXX was developed in c++ with Visual studio Express 10.

I played another game that tried this and failed, but this one really made them like people who I felt too guilty to kill. I really like the aliens in this, they're imaginatively designed and feel like they've been thought about much more than most people think about their game enemies (which coincidentally reflects one of the points of the game). It's definitely not without its flaws, though. I'm bugged a bit by how the guards can't jump high enough to climb around their own base, and it's kind of difficult to maneuver them.  The fact that only like a third of them fire at you is also a bit confusing, and although I noticed that they're the ones with violent personalities the other ones probably wouldn't just walk up to the dangerous alien that breached containment to say hi and make friends. I also felt like the controlling guards mechanic wasn't expanded on as far as it could have been, and I can imagine it being more puzzle oriented and successful.

Try to grab the red security key-card and then touch the red door labelled \"authorized staff only\" to make a break for it!\nProgrammed using HTML5 in javascript. Uses box2dweb and soundmanager2. Sound effects created by BSFXR. All art was drawn by hand using paper and markers, scanned and tinted in Photoshop.\nThis game runs at 480x800 resolution because it is designed to work on smartphones.  It runs wonderfully on my Android HTC Desire Z phone, for example.  If you have a non-HD (low resolution) monitor it will be too big to fit.  For example, it definitely won't fit on older netbook screens which only have 600 pixels of height.  I hope to make a smaller version for the people who still have low def screens.  Might just produce a half-size version.\nCurrently does not work in IE.  What a huge surprise.

This prevents you from grabbing a keycard, getting killed, but keeping the keycard after respawning.\n-Added sounds for the fireballs.\n-Randomized the fireball-pipe's first alarm a tiny bit.\n-Fireballs now destroy when they fall off the edge of the screen.\n-Made it so that using a terminal will reset the \"used\" status of checkpoints, so you can save again if you've just played a Boomka game.\n-Removed a couple of very frustrating spikes.\n-Moved around and added a couple of turrets, as well as some fireball-pipes.\n-Closed one of the exits early in the game, past a blue door.

There was a bug (sometimes, when you clicked a button, there were two levels loaded) which I fixed, and I made the last level a tiny bit harder (deleted some blocks).\n[/edit]\n----------------------------\nIn this game, you have to allure bunnies into cages, by building a path with the arrowkeys and holding a carrot.\nSounds easy? It is! But beware of the goblins and trolls!\nI had only less than 36 hours or so to make the game, and I learned a great portion of FlashPunk while doing it, so please be aware that there are some bugs. The biggest one is that the trolls somehow make invisible blocks ... :-/\nOther than that it is pretty playable, though I don't know if the last levels are beatable, or fun. ;-) [edit]I can confirm now that they are beatable.[/edit]\n----------------------------\nControls: (for LD version)\nArrowkeys -> Movement (+ Picking Blocks)\nR -> Restart Level\nQ/W -> Zoom (because it's fun)\n1/2 -> Switch Pick Mode (in Mode 2 you don't pick blocks anymore)\n----------------------------\nBTW, the game's gameplay was inspired by great classics like BoulderDash and Spherical.\n...\n*cough* And Minecraft. *cough*", "author": "ratking", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=3663", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10650964/BunniesBackIntoYourCage/BunniesBackIntoYourCage-source.zip", "Web (LD version)": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10650964/BunniesBackIntoYourCage/index.html", "Kongregate (Post-LD version)": "http://www.kongregate.com/games/RatKingsLair/bunnies-back-into-your-cage"}, "title": "Bunnies, Back Into Your Cage!", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/1872563bddba3e63448f03f97a9ac48a.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/ef5f4cbbb7962aa1b419930215010fe3.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 22, 2011 @ 9:00am", "uuav", "4651", "cool game, I find it a bit hard to play since I always drop the blocks when I want to jump around!

Sometimes they spawn in the shadows and are hard to see. Also no sound, sorry I barely managed to finish a game this time.\nNext time I'll try not to OCD over texture details, UV mapping and small misalignments in the meshes. I spent most of the weekend doing tedious adjustments that have little or no impact on the big picture v___v.\nHope you like it!\nEdit: Made one last mini bug fix 1h30 after the compo, the restart after the game over had some leftovers.

For example, increasing some kind of counter for goal fail in every \"failed\" conversation   and then checking it against global number of possibilites should work."]], "images": [{"url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/b9c31b8078db67bc2e182f04f3d873d7.jpg", "path": "full/a91ee5592086da037b0afd334b058962f96652d6.jpg", "checksum": "c4e13a5c5513ebf59352ecbe0dbefbaf"}, {"url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/81d67b34953c977f87b713b70bf7b438.jpg", "path": "full/b9615e4ecac5308ebf7bb28e5770c0eed9abc636.jpg", "checksum": "40d78eaeadb00e09e48579dc63ceb604"}, {"url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/4c598f6d4d4c9aa01b5fc647ae93b384.jpg", "path": "full/68271a6d8b384faa0828f01e17c937bdcd3da590.jpg", "checksum": "1ae2b15ad538a638395917f8f6d762b8"}]}

Red. Mr. Green is caught while attempting to infiltrate a building and needs your help getting out by unlocking and locking the doors in the complex. Try to trap the red guard units into spare rooms, so mr. Green has a clean passage.\nRunning the game:\nWindows users: use 'run.bat' to start the game (this will set the necessary environment variables)\nLinux and Mac OSX: You need Python 2.7 with the pyglet library to run this game. Execute 'python main.py' to start the game.\nControls:\nYour main control system is the terminal on the left of the screen. There you can enter commands to manipulate the systems on the network. Type 'help' at any time to find out the commands that are at your disposal. On the right is the blueprint of the current level. Mr. Green is indicated as a green dot. Enemy guard units are indicated with red.\nAs soon as enough information is available, mr. Green will plot out his intended route to his destination. You can guide him by opening and closing doors.\nTutorial:\nEnter the 'relays' command to discover all doors on the current level. The blueprint will show the door code names. Perform a 'scan' to get a hint which systems are on the network. You can 'connect' to each system using either its ip address or its canonical name. Doors can be 'locked' and 'unlocked', either allowing or preventing mr. Green to pass them.\nKnown bugs:\nSadly, some bugs make this game quite uninteresting.\n- The guards are really not that observant, so most of the time you can just run them over without them ever noticing you.\n- Another bug is in the third level, where the level switch event is not triggered.\n- Sometimes (observed in the second level), a guard will just run through a closed door.\nIn-game story (not fleshed out in game, due to time constraints):\nYou always knew something was off with this last job. Maybe it was the jittery behaviour of your contact or the fact that there was virtually no information available on the target. The pay was also substantially bigger than usual. Anyway, when mr. Green (a codename, of course) handed back the intel folder, you could not believe your ears when he told you he was in. Ordinarily, it was him that turned down potentially risky jobs. After all, it was his life on the line when the job went south. You were always safe, far away from the action. Well, if mr. Green wants to take the risk, you're game.\nThe first door was easy. The guard units were milling around, not really paying any attention to the intruder. Then again, the scramble software always did its job properly.\n...\nMr. Green: See? Nothing to it. Just an easy snatch and grab.\nMr. Red: It still does not sit right with me. Have you any idea what this company does or what we are stealing?\nMr. Green: No, I am only interested in remembering the building blueprints and the briefcase on LVL2.\nMr. Red: Just be quick about it. I want to be out of here rather sooner than later.\nMr. Green: Gee, what do your think ab...\nAnnouncer: Warning! Security has been breached! Warning! Deploying security drones.\nMr. Green: What are you doing!?!\nAnnouncer: Security drones deployed. Please lie facedown on the ground with your arms on your head. The drones will shoot any attempt at fleeing.\nMr. Green: You son-\nIt happended before you could react. The room mr. Green just stept in suddenly disappeared from the system. No camera feeds, no door controls, nothing. You try to reconnect with mr. Green, but no luck. His signal is dead. Your scans of the network yield no results. For almost an hour the network was dark.\nAn hour later, the system went back online, just as it was before the break in attempt. Shortly there after, mr. Greens signal came back.\nMr. Green: Red, come in!\nMr. Red: This is Red. Where are you?\nMr. Green: On the third level of the complex. They have some weird cell complex here. I think I am the only one here, but the guard units are buzzing around frantically.\nMr. Red: I am pulling up the schematics of the system. I am going to get you out. Hold tight!\nMr. Green: Hurry, will ya? I do not want to find out why all these cells are here.", "author": "ghostonline", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=4422", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1760333/ld21-win32.zip", "Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1760333/ld21-source.zip", "OS/X": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1760333/ld21-source.zip", "Linux": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1760333/ld21-source.zip"}, "title": "Terminal escape", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/c4807be225ed352bae9c4c848f3bfb89.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 23, 2011 @ 12:21am", "GigaClon", "1528", "I would get the EXE uploaded ASAP, you aren't going to get ratings until you do.

So let's name it an \"avoid them all\" game.\nThe more you avoid bullets, the more you score. Each bullet that goes out of the screen makes you earn 1 point.\nYour score fulfil a power gauge which allow you to active one of your 4 powers :\n1- Shield: glass shields block the bullets\n2- Nova: generate a nova circle around your ship and destroy all the bullets in it\n3- Mirror ball: makes the entire screen go BOOM and empty it\n4- Score x2: all bullets that go out of the screen make you earn 2 points !\nThe idea behind the game is not just to \"escape\" the bullets. It is to \"escape\" reality. Firstly through the universe of the game and secondly because in the real world you will never just avoid the bullets without shooting.\nAs you will see the game needs some improvements, balancing and lack from real musics and SFX. But don't worry ! This is just the first version. Updates will come soon :)\nWe hope you'll like the game in this first release. Do not hesitate to drop a word, feedback, comments, anything will be appreciate. See you for another Jam :)\nGameplay video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze7iF8JWjUs", "author": "Shifty", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=2855", "entry_type": ["Jam Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.shiftyweb.net/LD48/Pastagus_Fantasy-r1.zip"}, "title": "Pastagus Fantasy", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5cbb60a12cfeb2d760302bca4c68fa9b.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/70e88b06727af3001cd34f7bfc808df6.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/dd6b7517e3535b94efba767554f5317c.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/90c4b6c56e84bb0358138045003225b9.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/734395f3426528d8e54afc584873d5dd.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 25, 2011 @ 6:25am", "matthias_zarzecki", "3880", "I think \"bullet-hell\" is the approriate term :-)"], ["Aug 28, 2011 @ 10:29am", "Rudy", "4807", "I like the idea of the \"passive\" shooter.

It's up to your rainbow-making powers to lead Jones safely out of the temple and onto an early retirement!\n- Draw walls with the mouse!\n- Lead a hapless adventurer to fortune and a death from old age!\n- Deflect arrows, block off lava pools, intercept crushing walls of death!\n- Watch somebody else collect treasure, treasure, treasure!\n- Help Jones run very, very, fast from a giant fiery death boulder!\n- Use your spirit powers to view the world in slow-motion so you can better defend Jones!", "author": "demonpants", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=531", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.otcsw.com/files/DeathBoulderJones.zip", "Source": "http://www.otcsw.com/files/DeathBoulderJonesSource.zip", "OS/X": "http://www.otcsw.com/files/DeathBoulderJonesMac.zip"}, "title": "Death Boulder Jones", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/53aafc637ca5b9545fb91fbb7ced2135.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/5a09a40a539456008acfb86bb46ba040.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/09d4ee680ecd780eaa5479151827c8c0.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/12122ae800e863f98a52e8e3d9c6c528.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/7ade7062d9a962b8461b759af092de89.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/plugins/compo2/images/igold.gif"], "comments": [["Aug 22, 2011 @ 4:56pm", "maxx", "5660", "The idea is pretty good, but the game is too hard from the beginning.

Far from my first LD but things did not go so smoothly. Had some other things to do these two days but still managed to sit some 20 hours behind computer.\nSadly only something like 10 were productive.\nSo, theme was too broad for my taste so I just started working on something I wanted to try for a while, to make a 2D Toribash like ragdoll toy. And I did. Had bunch of ideas how to make it in to an escape game afterwards. In the end went with zero gravity escape as with gravity its probably even more complex to control it then in Toribash lol :D\nUsed Flash and Box2D . No time and motivation left to do graphics and sounds so pure code only ;/ But it has its own charm, will work more on graphics later :)\n<Rant alert>\nSo it was my worst LD ever ;( Firstly got stuck with some angle calculations(well usual stuff) but then...\n- Then my mouse broke ;(\n- Then second mouse broke in same way which made me wonder if it is my notebook?!?!\n- So I was finishing it in frustration with broken mouse and a touch pad. Considering that mouse is main input method here it was horrible.\n- So those 10 hours of trying to figure out what happened with mouse and trying to achieve at least something with touchpad were hours reserved for sounds, graphics and normal level went in to ;/\n- Anyways it seems it is biggest LudumDare yet, so I was stuck trying to upload at 4Am until my own internet went down completely 0_o, just to add to problems and frustrations. So its actually good that submission was extended 12 hours because of site problems :)\n</Rand alert>\nSo, some strong speech and frustration for me here, but ah well, at least played with things I wanted :D Hope when frustration will goes away will experiment with this more. It should be a fun template for various types of games.\nUpdate:\nAdded a video to YouTube with me passing this game http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvdpZ4PiAO0 hope it will help people who never played Toribash to figure some things out, few advices:\n- Use space to pause the game and issue many commands at once\n- Remember about center of mass when you try to push\n- Relaxed parts absorb shocks, stiff ones bounce, so its a good idea to be relaxed when you don't want to bounce, or stiff all parts when you want to push with maximal force\n- And it is space, if you are flying in right direction just relax and wait, no need to go crazy and ruin your right direction :)", "author": "wonderwhy", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=232", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.wonderwhy-er.com/ld21/ZeroGravityEscape.exe", "Web": "http://www.wonderwhy-er.com/ld21/ZeroGravityEscape.html", "Source": "http://www.wonderwhy-er.com/ld21/LudumDare21.zip"}, "title": "Zero Gravity Escape", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/683a28282ed532b5ab6e3fa7eace2bc6.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 22, 2011 @ 6:58pm", "poohshoes", "5776", "Harder than QWOP, Extremely hard to control they guy, I kept accidentally starting a drag box instead of clicking on the joint."], ["Aug 22, 2011 @ 7:48pm", "dev_zero", "199", "I couldn't figure out how to make any progress in this game world because the controls felt, to me, very chaotic.

Never had to distribute an XNA game before. Thought they would work out of the box.\nIt's my first time participating in LD and the first \"serious\" game I did by myself.\nSadly there is not much content due to huge time problems.\nIn exchange the difficulty curve is insane in the two levels it has.\nIf the HiDef-version doesnt work for you, try out the Reach-version! If the Reach version doesn't work pls specify the error you get.\nI didn't include the uncompressed audio files in the source as they take 300mb of space. If you want to compile it you have to remove all occurences where the AudioManager or AudioHelper is used.\nThe music was generated using http://tones.wolfram.com/generate/ . I hope this is allowed seeing how programs such as bfxr are allowed to generate sound effects.\nThere is currently a bug in that bosses sometimes dont spawn if you play the game in one session. If you find a blue orb without there being a boss you should restart the game. You can use the resume feature afterwards to start at your last checkpoint and the boss should be there this time (if you didnt save after picking up the blue orb).\nI might expand upon this game in the future.

It's essentially a frantic game of attrition, getting quicker and quicker until The Runner ultimately dies. With any luck, you'll get more and more panicked as your Light starts to dwindle and more and more enemies start to spawn.\nThe controls and instructions are in-game, but let me know if anything needs explaining.\nThe graphical style ended up looking really cool in action, but there are a few things I would change if I did it again (most of them involving getting more sleep and ingesting less caffeine in some way).\nOne major note that I forgot to put into the instructions is that powerups have a chance to drop from enemies when they die. Light+ boosts The Guide's Light radius (which has a hard limit) and Move+ permanently increases The Guide's movement speed.\nMore than anything else in the game, I didn't like the fact that your ability to generate Light is based entirely on luck. I've toyed with the idea of being able to regenerate light by being near a lantern (and the people who playtested it mentioned it too), but I couldn't get it implemented in a way in which it doesn't break the balance of the game.\nHints and Tips:\n- Don't pick up too many Speed+ powerups! More control is often needed.\n- Use the Lanterns to your advantage. Although they're not the best shield, they'll do in a pinch if you're low on Light.\n- Don't kill every Flyer you see. They always release a Red Bullet when they die. Sometimes you're better off leaving them.\n- When your COMBO hits 20/40/60/..., if you're not on full ammo for your right-click weapon, you'll get 1 ammo.\n- Only use your right-click weapon when it's essential. It resets your COMBO and significantly hinders your score.\nLet me know what you think of it and what score you get, my highest is 122460!\nTools used:\nGame Maker\nbfxr", "author": "Nihilate", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=4068", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.mediafire.com/?n5az07z75dz085u", "Source": "http://www.mediafire.com/?adaz3ad32sadsid"}, "title": "BlackWhiteRed", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/0a99f4e94d6cf082842fabd6bfc08412.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/abac12d18959462182a4c9806028e75c.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/205ed6a7d071dbeb2469071581c07a98.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/9941b7ade0ee03c7c2e896ddfc1d3102.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/2357ac3c884dd439751c3117dc9b41ba.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 22, 2011 @ 4:15pm", "Andrew", "5432", "Awesome, I like how you're in control of the guardian and not the victim for a change.

As you explore you can find different elemental modes to aid you in escaping unscathed from the numerous monsters out to get you.\nKeys:\nArrow keys: movement\nEsc: Exit\n1 - raw mode (default mode. Gives you more health)\n2 - light mode (enemies notice you more, but after 5 seconds you get path finding to nearby objects of interest)\n3 - plant mode (slower movement but decreased damage from enemies and increased health regen)\n4 - lightning mode (take damage over time but damage nearby enemies)\n5 - water mode (enemies lose all friction and have worse control (doesn't work well, don't use))\n6 - shadow mode (enemies less likely to notice you, but you take more damage)\n7 - air mode (you move a lot faster, but are extremely vulnerable to damage)\nTested in both linux and windows. You need python2.6 (or greater but not 3.0), pygame and python_openGL to run.\nCan download pygame installer for windows easily, but I found for pyOpenGL I had to download setuptools and run from the command line\nTo run the game, just run the \"elemental_escape.py\" file.\nc:\\python26\\scripts\\easy_install.exe PyOpenGL PyOpenGL-accelerate\nKnown issues:\n-Framerate is quite low (I think due to locking inefficiencies between movement and drawing threads)\n-Water mode allows monster to go very fast due to poor drag model.\n-Sometimes you (and monsters) can cut through the walls at their ends (not a big deal but not perfect)\n- breadth first search for path-finding (light mode) is inefficient. Maximum path-size is probably a good idea so the light-mode only checks for nearby items.\nToDo:\n- Text to the screen for detailing keys to use, powers from the modes, that you've won the game, or lost the game, etc.\n- Better graphics (including animations), sound.\n- More than one kind of enemy, more interesting escape from them.\nTips on playing the game:\n- Monsters are less agile than you are. If you quickly dodge them effectively they can't find you.\n- You always start in the bottom-left of the maze, and the exit is always at the top-right of the maze.\nAlso just a warning: I should've said this earlier so sorry to those who put the effort in and were disappointed. I did this game in very little time and I'm not really very experienced in game programming. The main problem is that I got it working and then didn't tweak it to be actually fun.

It should really have more levels, but it was hard enough to make a single one and I don't have any more time. You run through a maze, find things blocking your path, and find things to unblock your path.

It's an action-puzzler about speed, precision, space, and color. A Blob creature, known as Bloopie, makes its escape from a Gnomish prison. There are 27 short levels in this frantic tetris-meets-frogger arcade.\nThe idea is to dodge globular bullets coming at you from all sides as you make your way to the top of the level. If you are hit, the glob attach to Bloopie, becoming an extension of its body. So just don't get hit right? Not so simple... Blocking your path are laser force field gates which must be disarmed by sacrificing an exposed glob of matching color from Bloopie's body. Don't have the right color handy? Just absorb it from the bullets. But here's where it gets fun--the glob bullets are initially all grey. An absorbed glob adopts the color of the floor tile where it was absorbed! Pay heed to next color you'll need... and get the bullet in the right spot! Stay thin or get stuck and crushed in the stone gateway exit.\nWhat I used to make this game:\nA netbook.\nFlash Develop\nFlex compiler\nFlixel 2.55\nA desktop with crash-a-lot hardware (for music/graphics).\nPxtone (ptVoice and ptCollage)\nNow a few notes on my first experience with Ludum Dare:\nI've been wanting to compete in ld48 or the jam for a few years now, but haven't had the time. I wasn't really prepared for this one either... I just stumbled here in the first several hours of competition and decided to join in. I'm so glad I did--it was a blast!\nUnfortunately my first game could not be polished as well as I would have liked before presenting it. There are some bugs, although the whole thing is quite playable and enjoyable throughout. I never did beat it in development, although I have just now for the first time while writing this... so you can except it to get quite challenging. Some honest advice: The game will tend to hide its bugs if you don't mash keys. Keen sight and a little hesitance will escape through the final 10 levels.\nI'm especially proud of the idea this game presents. I plan to improve on it in the future, starting with some fixes and features that didn't make the 7pm (PST) contest deadline.\nAnd last but not least.. I'm VERY MUCH looking forward to trying out YOUR games over the next few weeks!", "author": "Edsploration", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=5758", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Web": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18420968/GlobularPrisonbreak.swf", "Post-Compo (major bugs fixed)": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18420968/BloopieEscape.swf", "Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18420968/GlobularPrisonbreak.7z"}, "title": "Globular Prisonbreak!", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/8a9435cb70eda2ca84092fbdc469f3f7.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/91e5aea4f3317f177249be2499566c68.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/00f1138ef5b94525617b96edc1ffc0a4.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/141640ca16b82c4815899239a220641a.jpg", "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/aef46991b6299fcc721a6d0c8db4e0fe.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 23, 2011 @ 12:04am", "GigaClon", "1528", "nice concept but the game itself could use work.

However, I had ideas for the three top-rated themes, and I knew I'd be spending three hours on a train, during which time I might as well be making games, so I decided to have a go at making a game for Ludum Dare on an extra-short schedule.\nIn the end I managed to spend about five hours on this game, but it wasn't really enough. It's a bullet hell game, but I didn't write code that's flexible enough to generate sufficiently interesting patterns.

Your mission is to guide him through the everchanging network of duckboards, collect the Wisplings he needs to reactivate the Seal he came through and take one step closer to the home. To be honest though, the level are procedurally generated and the difficulty increases indefinitely, so the road is quite long. Maybe we need a sequel to relieve the Wisp from his torment?\nControls are explained in-game, but we forgot a couple of details in the rush: You can skip to the opposite side of the maze by moving the Wisp outside the screen, providing that the block on the other side is accessible. Also if you stay still for a moment, the platforms directly under you will move. This is meant to prevent getting stuck so easily. The game can also be played with Xbox 360 controller if you have one hanging around.\nSpiritual was made by Team Jolly Roger for 21st Ludum Dare, using XNA Game Studio 4.0. Feel free to give us feedback or suggestions at teamjollyroger.com, or check us out on Facebook.

Space to Jump. Space to release from crane. Didn't have time to put in \"restart key\" so if you get stuck you'll have to restart the app.\nScratchy Get Out! is an arcade game where you \"Scratchy\" have to figure out how to escape from the room. I kind of molded it in after classic arcade games like Mario Bros.\nI should point out this is as much a puzzle game as it is an arcade game. It is pretty tricky but it is solvable. You will definitely have to use your brain to escape the room. You have to pick up items, operate machinery, etc to win.\nWARNING:\nThe feedback coming in is that the game is way too hard. The level that I managed to build would normally be like the last level of a 20 level game. It has everything thrown in it and I made it as hard as possible. If I had had more time I could have made the tutorial levels necessary to make it not so frustrating for players. The one thing I really screwed up on was running out of time before I could build more levels. I had this wonderful toolbox ready and I could have easily built more levels (especially easier ones) if I had just had time. Oh well, I learned a lot with stencyl so next time my progress will be better.\nDue to people having so many issues with making progress, here is the walkthrough:\nSPOILER*******************\nJump over the growlers and get a boulder. Climb the rope and jump on the cannon. The boulder should load into the cannon (if you aren't standing on top of the cannon). Then the cannon should fire the boulder into the crane. Drop the boulder on the blue rock by controlling the crane. the rock should break if you hit it. By the way, due to a bug, always wait at least 10 seconds after loading the crane before dropping a boulder. Ok, now you have a way to get back down and get more boulders. Keep doing so and reloading the cannon and try to kill off as many of the obstacles (knifers and growlers) that you think you need to to make it easy to get more boulders. Once you feel safe, start dropping the boulders on all of the things above the exit. Once you have cleared a path to the exit, then this time load a boulder but stay on top of the boulder. This might take a few tries (you have to be on the boulder just right). But then if done correctly the boulder should shoot you up into the crane and you will be stuck in it. Now move the crane over to where the exit is and release down. You have escaped!\nEND SPOILER ***********************************\nUsed stencyl to program and generate flash swf. Will post more details later. Posted on Kongregate.\nI am continuing to develop this game. Already I have a version that adds a cool indiana jones boulder dodging level and fixes some of the annoying bugs. Right now I'm providing the new version as an SWF. The best way to play is to download the SWF file and play in fullscreen mode. This is smoother and makes it seem more like an arcade game. You can download the SwF here:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/5866491/Scratchy%20Get%20Out%21.swf\nThere are two known bugs (that manage to make the game even harder, not easier of course):\n1. the \"getting high\" bug (if you get this you have to reload the game).\n2. the \"crumbling boulder\" bug (the workaround here is to wait 10 seconds after loading the crane with a boulder before releasing it).\nHere is a video walkthrough that might help you finish the game:\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/5866491/BeatScratchy/BeatScratchy.mp4", "author": "sfernald", "url": "http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-21/?action=preview&uid=258", "entry_type": ["48 Hour Competition Entry"], "downloads": {"Windows": "http://www.kongregate.com/games/Dogstar669/scratchy-get-out", "Web": "http://www.kongregate.com/games/Dogstar669/scratchy-get-out", "Linux": "http://www.kongregate.com/games/Dogstar669/scratchy-get-out", "OS/X": "http://www.kongregate.com/games/Dogstar669/scratchy-get-out", "Source": "http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5866491/Scratchy%20Get%20Out%21%20Source.zip"}, "title": "Scratchy Get Out!", "image_urls": ["http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/e1970b091d9a4c8468197607c3119f2e.jpg"], "comments": [["Aug 23, 2011 @ 5:15am", "johnfn", "3187", "I just couldn't figure out this game, and I died like 20 times.
