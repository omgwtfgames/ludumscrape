Hum - it's a good game which needed some efficiency, but it seems to me you MUST choose between a race game or a battle game. In fact these games are interesting but in this strange cocktail I have a doubt - it's so confusing. Thank you for this cool experience. Soon I will see the shaders which you have used ++

That's a lot of controls required to fly/fight :) would have preferred a more simple control scheme/solution. Also lags a lot on my Mac

Yes if it's a Humor .Ok i will rate 3 stars.But Really what's about gameplay .Gameplay is not working with the design .Next time try to solve the connection between gameplay and design ,so they both looks beautiful .But it's fun for 48 hour game
Wow, I am impressed, the graphics are awesome and have a very retro-early-nintendo64-feel to it. Really liked it!

Very nice, I got very impressed with the effect on the terrain.

Neat setup - Love the color-effects!

Very nice graphic effects. Good job.

Nice visual style and interesting game mechanic. Was confused about what I should be doing, and sometimes felt like I was 'unfairly ambushed/killed' Really cool!

The lofi graphics are bomb. This is pretty sick, I could totally see some multiplayer madness with this game.

Awesome job! It is awesome!

Loved the filter / gprahics style, was great. Also the gameplay was a lot of fun, I loved the combination of flying / racing / shooting and having WASD to fly while aiming with the mouse was great. My type of game! (made me think of starfox on the n64)

Incredible!

The graphics are probably the most impressive, with the colors as you get close to stuff, seeing enemies through the level geometry etc.

Controls were good, gameplay was alright though not very engaging.

The masterpiece superman 64's developers were trying to create.

This was really fun! I'm digging the art style a lot and the controls are very smooth. Good job!
I wish I could've compared my time with other players (maybe something like a leader-board).

Very well done.

Having issues running this in Chrome, can't get out of the main screen.

Nice lighting effects! (but yes you should improve the gameplay ;)

You sure made a lot in 48 hours :-) When I missed a ring I got really confused though :P The graphics were great, and some decent sound effects!

Really interesting graphical effects! Especially the color aberrations of the ground i liked. Incredible for only 48 hours of work! I don't really see how this fits the theme though...

Enjoyed playing your game, controls were pretty easy, loved the graininess and colorful textures when you got up close. Only problem I had was when racing large packs of enemies would be going the opposite direction... rationally I should move because there's to many but my instinct for top speed pushed me forward and ultimately to my death.

Very impressed by the 3D, unfortunately I only got halfway through lap 3 a couple of times but never made it to the end. Battling the enemies in flight was kind of hard, maybe the mouse could be more sensitive for faster aiming. But that would mess up the flying I guess, hmmm. Anyway, I enjoyed the game but it needs some more balance

This game looks crazy dude. Loved playing it. Will defnetly come back later again.

Interesting game. I enjoyed the visuals like the nice colour effect when you get close to the ground. Not sure how I feel about being able to collide with the rings though. Found it very frustrating when I would bounce off of the rings awkwardly after building up a lot of speed. Overall, cool game! I really liked the visual style.

Really nice game! Great music!

fantastic graphics <3 Impressive!

Neat visuals. Love the colors bleeding into the grayscale landscape.
Gameplay was kinda confusing at times, for example I didn't really get how the laps worked. How many rings count as one lap? And what if I skipped one of the sequence? Do I have to go back and get it, or can I just keep going?
Also, the shooting part felt out of place. I rarely used it as it distracted me from getting all the rings, and it didn't feel as polished as the racing.
Apart from that, I quite enjoyed it. Good work!

I like the idea. Nice, well polished graphics considering time constrain. Good job.

Intense action.

And interesting combination of genres, but it doesn't work too well for me - on my first try I got 1 1/2 laps by just racing, and on my second try I tried shooting, but got killed pretty quickly. The art and sound on the other hand are pretty good!
